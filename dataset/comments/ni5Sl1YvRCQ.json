It's sad that many NCTzens consider him as one of the weak dancers in NCT but I'm 100% sure those who said it didn't even see his fancams or even see him dance. His moves are so powerful and big yet it is very detailed,  he doesn't miss any moves or beats. Just like Johnny said, He is very fluid just like a feather. Even most idols his height couldn't even dance like him\n\nbtw not just his dance, but also his vocals and visuals are overlooked. heck this boy can even rap cause that's how talented he is, he needs more appreciation fgs.", 'ivory lemons': "WTH this ain't soft", 'shipyour Favoriteyoutubers': 'UWU 😍😍😍😍❤❤❤', 'Azi Shagnal': 'Were there 10 cameras?
