shaqw19	i agree with you about the assisted passing nep but ea have made it ridiculous to play semi assisted for passing and shooting all the way up to fifa 16 semi assisted wa insane and certainly meta now it trash it one of the mechanic i dont understand them changing making assisted better and making semi assisted worse lowered the skill gap dramatically same with the passive defending mechanic we have now it should be rewarding to read your opponent and control the situation yourself not a punishment the game becoming bigger a an esport yet le skilful at the same time

RMI _96	I think that Oscar is the better player His dribbling and shooting is good and his passing is phenomenal which could make him a fantastic CAM CF Renato Augusto is more balanced but I think there are too many similar player to him for example Paulinho So I m getting Oscar but it depends on what type of player you prefer

Owen Thornley	Referring to the draft to glory do you think you should be able to pick you ’ re reward like you can for div rival to avoid getting frustrated when you get the pack you don ’ t desire I think this should especially be valid for draft win but maybe not for the first 3 round

Darragh Flynn	Hi nep do you think that squad battle is worth playing love the vids keep up the good work
ArsenalBowler	Hey Nep in my opinion the sport psychologist idea is a really good one Majority of people don t take eSports serious enough to realize that a psychologist can play an essential part to playing consistently at a very high level and being able to consistently handle the pressure situation we re put under I m in the National Team in my country for the sport I play Bowling and used to be afraid of the psychologist a if I wa crazy to see one or something However I started seeing a Sports Psychologist 2 year ago a I advanced from the youth to adult level and found so much clarity in the understanding of my own mental psyche and how to control it to respond appropriately to pressure situation I later used these experience from seeing the Sports Psychologist into my eSports career a well captaining a team of nobody into finishing 4th in a gaming league out of 24th an achievement considering no one gave u a chance to finish out of the bottom 5 Hope you actually go on to seeing a Sports Psychologist because it would clearly help you so much and be able to help you relax under pressure while still producing top quality content for u Keep up the great work Nep

Harvey Lewis	Rating matchmaking can ’ t be a thing co I use a full Portsmouth squad when I ’ m bored and it ’ s 166 overall and I game up against a 187 2 time in a row
Tom 4444	I ’ m the same a the guy you mention at 17 00 I played my first and only weekend league this week and just got gold 1 My front three are promes cl Rodrigo and dembele and I didn ’ t face any real superteams until my last 5 10 game I think rating may be a part of matchmaking IMO I don ’ t think it would effect the skill of opponent that much
David Peacock	Team rating is definitely NOT accounted for in WL However it should I had a 182 team and 90 of the team I played were 186 and it s so frustrating because Neymar or Suarez will score a ridiculous goal that my player could never do I can beat those team if the player is awful but if they re on my level or better then I can never win It really put me off playing the game
ActiveSubscriber017864259992	Hey Nep can you do a mini review on Renato Augusto for all the people thinking about getting him

Cole Amuzu	If you aren t sure if you wan t to go to full normal rtg You could do it in a fantasy football format where you get to buy one player after every weekend league to try and improve your squad slowly overtime
Thomas Mitchell	Hey Nep love the RTG series watching you play ha improved my game so much Maybe try celebrating the good goal you score more a well a other thing you do well to take the pressure off I m very self critical and you seem it a well and sometimes just enjoying playing and focusing on that help you play better There s a time for both analysing and enjoying Respect your grind 🙏

Alex Sher	I agree with the comment in this video I have a 250k team and finished 11 5 in weekend league not once matching anyone with an icon and very few team over a million coin Possibly just worse player having worse team or maybe there is some sort of rating matching on champ Love to see you test this out in the future good luck to the rtg love you mate
JanickR8	wow great pre order pack

Kodi Byrne	hey nep im a huge fan been watching since fifa 13 i wa just wondering if anyone agrred with my problem with the price of pack in this game for example a 50k pack give 12 rare gold player so 2 x 50k pack is the same a a 100k pack which is fine but a 45k pack give 12 gold player and only 6 rares for just 5k le than a 50k pack which to me is just illogical because 2 x 45k pack is the same a 1 x 50k pack 1 gold player pack which is 12 5k because a gold player pack is 12 gold player 1 rare the 12 rares of a 50k pack what im saying is why should we have to pay 90k for 2 x 45k pack when you can get the same for a total value of 62 5k for a 50k 12 5k Also why is a rare gold pack which is 25k coin or 500 fifa point and a premium gold player pack that is also worth 25k coin or 350 fifa point when they have the same coin value according to ea Just to add in a mega pack which cost 35k coin or 700 fifa point you have a 4 5 chance of a 87 rated player and a 1 9 chance of a scream card but in a 45k pack or 600 fifa point you get a 4 chance of a 87 rated and a 1 8 chance of a scream card it s not a big difference but why is the 45k pack 10k more when it is 100 worse yet the mega pack is more fifa point but le coin i really hope you see this nep considering this is a first owner road to glory pack are a big part of the series and i think this is a good talking point keep up the great vids nep and i hope your family is good and well this formula theory can be applied to just about every pack type
Tudor-Alexandru Șcraba	Neppo get Renato Augusto he is a dirty disguisting OP CM I score banger from 35yds with him he s tall he ha 80 strength great shooting and passing perfect for a CM and decent defending Trust me he is a OP CM
Crootdog Gaming	Hey Neppo I m not sure how effective form actually is Towards the end of FIFA 18 I wa a gold 1 gold 2 player in Weekend League This weekend league my first Weekend League of FIFA 19 I only just scraped silver 1 in my last game of the Weekend League I needed 2 win from 10 to secure silver 1 and only just got it However at one point I wa around the 9 14 record due to a few disconnect I then came up against 2 top 100 player in my last 5 game A silver 2 player surely shouldn t be coming up against top 100 player Would be interested to hear your thought on this Love the content and hope everything is well in your life

Josh 1013	How have you packed UCL bale
BABYFACE0895	Hey Nep first let me say im a huge fan been with you since fifa 14 and thanks to you I ve improved my gameplay so much My q is I ve seen in your last few episode especially today s that you try and guess where your opponent will shoot by moving your goalkeeper and majority of those time you ve left an open goal to concede Just wondering do you actually think moving your goalkeeper work or is it best to play it safe and let the keeper save shot normally

James Fuller	As a solution to some player becoming extinct on the market during certain sbcs I think that every player should be able to be purchased directly from an EA catalogue in game at all time for either their maximum price range price or a little over For example if a player s price range is 2 000 to 35 000 coin you should be able to buy that player from a catalogue for 40 000 coin This would not affect the transfer market at all but prevent player from ever becoming extinct
