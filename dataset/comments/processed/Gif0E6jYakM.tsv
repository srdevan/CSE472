チェック タータン	음 이번에는 작년 Cherry Bomb에 비해 강렬한 임펙트이 부족하네요 다만 세계적으로 공격하자로 이런 아쉬운 방향으로 가자고 된 것이지만 역시 어딘가 무리 너무있는 느낌이 부정 할 수 없어 그들은 아직 젊은니까 좀 그 젊음을 나타낸 신선하고 세련된 노래를 불러 줘야한다고 생각하고 이것이라고 BTS의 IDOL에 져 버릴거야 세련된 것은 잘 알고 있었지만 거기에 좀 어린 소년 특유의 활기찬 부분 이랄까 개성도 도입했으면 좋았다는 게 이번 그들의 신곡을 듣고 소감은 솔직히 까 그 점 BTS는 어린 소년 특유의 천진난 만함 할까 활기찬 조금 悪乗り 느낌을 음악으로도 성능도 잘 도입하고 충분히 개성이 빛나고 있었다고 생각하고 IDOL은 지금도 머릿속에 강하게 남아 있어요 즉 임팩트면에서는 BTS의 IDOL 쪽이 이기고있는 것은 아닐까 나는 생각 하네

Gabriella Catenacci	BTS and Nct make me think k pop is better than pop Now in the pop industry if you ’ e talking and music is playing you can be in the industry In k pop you have to work work day and night for hour to get the right move for the dance or note K pop they have more work done into while pop music is just no they don ’ t even care Basically every k pop song I ’ ve seen had very complex choreography meanwhile when I watch a pop song the singer is just acting sometimes or standing there Not all k pop artist have complex choreography but a majority ha at least ha choreography I personally think working in the k pop industry is way more hardworking exhausting and you also have to be experienced to be called a trainee so I think I would best be in a pop music video or a pop star never a k pop star because I could never be on the same level a Nct BTS Blackpink iKon EXO Twice etc Sorry that it ’ s long I just wanted to state my opinion I know some pop music video have extreme choreography but I don ’ t see it a lot from really popular artist that we all adore I mostly watch k pop though so I ’ m not that wise about pop I used to watch it a lot before I found k pop some people may disagree with me but this is just an opinion Okay bye I ’ m going to watch a BTS music video now or the mashup between bts mic drop nct 127 cherry bomb and exo monster Probably the mashup because it ’ s amazing if you ’ re still reading check it out after this one It ’ s good K bye

misa yamanaka	I think I have to say it here SM know what they doing even for the line distribution Winwin doing great with all the second he got He still able to gather the fan with all the scene he got He also get the chance to show his personality in nct life etc He got enough chance Vocal line can be heard through out the song The adlibs are all awesome Shame on you if you couldnt appreciate it I think it reasonable that TY and Mark got more scene line The new observant potential fan need to notice someone they know to not feeling too confused while watching the mv perf So I DO think it important that both of them more noticeable than the others New fan usually switch their bias to other member when they finally know them better dont they I feel like to many people complaining about this when Im sure it a good strategy I know that it not a popular opinion though

geuss whilo	what s wrong with this group I m really confused I followed this group from debut when SM introduced them I followed they member honest SM ha many visual member Have amazing voice and also amazing dance even for this time I admit that SM ha a reliable rapper but why doe it seem like you haven t reached your goal yet SM should pay more attention to their goal of debuting their artist according to the concept rather than multiplying member Yes I know SM want have a different concept but didnt see you forcing your ego even though you have enough to have member to be honest you are left with other agency that are starting to break down the concept for the better whether or not the agency is in the same class a SM even a small agency is no le interesting not enough we criticize about style it seems like I think I ve started thinking with the concept you made try to understand your artist nowadays people sell talent not for how much good look they have to be honest I don t really like jyp but this time I wa truly amazed by his extraordinary rookie and this rarely happens jyp ha a different concept they work hard from the member and staff so I think Sm must work harder to believe in the artist in the work really stray kid is more awesome please sm improve your performance this is for the hard working group I judge based on the work not how much good look it ha

ship namjin	Actually I think that the view are so low because of the English version that appeared first than the Korean one an unusual thing for kpop at least I never seen this kind of thing happen and believe me I ve been here for long ahahaha Also the view of the English version are higher just because fan got used to it and when the Korean MV wa released at least for me they obviously were a little confused about it and maybe continued with the English one These are only my opinion but actually for me I love both

Xah Nah Park	how long will I wait for the dance practice
Miley Zane	Why is it when the view are low everyones is blaming youtube like I recently joined this fandom from the like i can see around 374k ppl liked the video and all fan will like the video so genuinely I believe this is the actual view count and im pretty sure out of tht 375k 100 000 people aren ’ t streaming or they are and are doing it incorrectly the song like 4min so u can watch it 15 time in an hour literally speaking however you need to make 10 15min break or the view wont be counted like so honestly in 24hrs in sure the view count is pretty accurate and a lot of ppl have seen the English ver so they probably cba to so stream this song honestly idek like the whole rumour or theory that word like stream or view delete ur view is actually a joke it sound so forced Honestly my point is all the negative comment about low view and ive been streaming for hour is annoying like 1 person giving a video 1 000 view doesn ’ t give real achievement to the artist cause truly and honestly not tht many ppl have seen it I generally just look at the like of the video And no im not attacking nct im just against the streaming culture but if u wan na do it dnt complain when the view are low because trust me youtube is sick of it a well So let all just be happy for their current exposure and future achievement they could get and dont ob over the 24hr view rank

Fareeha Farid	YouTube deleting view is normal when the view are robotic or spam More than 10M view got decreased from BTS s music video too If you re watching or streaming through different device but same account then the view is counted a spam You need multiple account to stream if you re doing it that way Stream well NCTzens 💚🍃

25XO5	Meaning wise I 100 prefer the Korean ver more I m so used to how hard hitting the English one go that the Korean ver feel slightly more toned down probably to cater to the different market listener BUT Regular still GOES in both English and Korean ngl Also shout out to Haechan looking good a heck in all his scene I SEE YOU FULL SUN But also I don t see mr moon Where did you go but that Haechan x Taeil part at the very end good in English even better in Korean w

Minh Thúy Đào	these are the MOST CORRECT RULES of streaming the video on Youtube 1 Watch the video FROM THE FIRST UNTIL THE LAST SECOND NOT ONLY the first 10 30 second or half of it but THE WHOLE VIDEO It will prove that u are interested in the video and not here just for increasing the view Youtube will paying ONLY for faithful view keep it in mind Also to those who said that watching the first 10 30 second of the video will counted a view it s available for Spotify but it doesn t work on Youtube 2 Watch the video in HD 720p at least Youtube logic is that user will watch the video in the most comfortable for their eye quality We all know how 360 240 144p are suck and if we can afford we are always trying to put it in higher quality If u can afford stream in HD if ur device hasn t HD or ur internet connection is low then 480p is allowed 3 DON T skip stop or rewind the video 4 The sound on ur phone should be more then 50 u can use earphone on it but the sound should stay more then 50 U can mute the sound on ur laptop and PC but be sure that the volume on Youtube is more then 50 5 Before rewatching the same video u should DELETE the watching and searching history the watching history is THE BROWSING HISTORY and the searching history is COOKIES 6 LOG OUT after the first watching of the video bc from one acc u can watch the same video ONLY ONCE in hour But if u have a few account then delete the whole history after watching the video log out from one acc and log in another one close a tab and open a new one and then research this MV again for rewatching Don t forget to leave comment and like 7 STREAM MANUALLY Don t use the playlist and loop when u have a free time for watching the video on Youtube Playlists and loop are the main reason of freezing the view for a long time also not all of view from them will be counted by Youtibe system only 10 30 By using playlist and loop u are just proving that u are LISTENING TO THE SOUND FROM THE VIDEO but NOT WATCHING IT AT ALL And Youtube is a VIDEO portal where u should WWATCH THE VIDEOS not a music portal like Spotify Remember that Youtube like to delete unfaithful view 8 DON T USE multiple tab or incognito mode they are counted a SPAM and ur view will be deleted for sure 9 Don t replay the video or refresh the page for rewatching ur view will be counted a SPAM and will be deleted for sure 10 DON T SKIP THE ADS They are counted a part of the video and if u will skip them u actually will skip the video and ur view will not counted by Youtube 10 Don t change the speed of the video 11 Use different browser Mozilla Firefox Opera Google Chrome and etc account internet connection Wi Fi and mobile data device PC TV phone laptop for streaming of the video these thing will helping to increase the view 12 Comment Like Share by the video on social medium and with friend 13 AND NOW THERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE you CAN T REWATCH the same video again and again without any gap If u will rewatch Not Today on repeat again and again ur view will be counted a SPAM and deleted for sure

Haey Embin	RobotView Yt will count it even if u skip ad because that s how the world s work no one will watch an ad unless you want to be bored that s why they have a skip button believe me all human skip ad They also count it in whatever pixel or audio volume for those with slow internet or want a low volume some people listen to low vol so it s accepted But you must not watch it consecutively because they ll think you re a robot manipulating the system and view won t count esp in one IP Robot view don t count that s what matter to them Thanks

monsterkukie	I wonder why company think that the public won t like a song if the line distribution is fair I mean wouldn t it bring in more fan if more member were in the spotlight Like some people might incline to certain visual voice dance style AND it give member an opportunity to be more equally popular So when they have solo album and such they ll bring in revenue And the member are le likely to leave the company From a business point of view I realize they re playing it traditionally safe by feeding fan of the popular member but they risked by bringing NCT 127 to America cause a lot of idol have attempted but their hype didn t last long And equal distribution isn t even that big of a risk It worked with Dream

TaeStan 95	I think people need to stop talking about the line distribution SmEnt ha always been doing this They pick favourite and give them more line than others let just hope in the future the other member will get more line I think we should just focus on streaming this we did well on the English version so let get them alot more view so it easier for them to get a win I know there might be something wrong with the view but i think it YouTube again don ’ t blame nctzens We all have to do stuff in life let just stream whenever we can Views are important but so is voting and buying their album a well a downloading the digital album Nctzens let get these boy a win Fighting 💚

BEAUxii	PLS READ You can only get up to 6 view in a 24 hour period on one ip address more likely 3 but I would suggest watching the video every 4 hour except when sleeping because if you constantly stream youtube may take away all your view Going to place with free wifi so it ’ s a different IP address could work or using the data on your phone is also a different IP address but that will cost you data obviously But remember it ’ s only up to 6 view When the view count freeze it mean youtube is auditing view count because people are streaming incorrectly making it look like bot Don ’ t blame other fandom for reporting the video with no proof Judging by the like the video should have around 4 million but again people are streaming incorrectly making thing look suspicious to youtube

LaoCai Nguyen	Youtube ha been stricter with vi3w counting these day i must say especially with music video and after some big kpop group increasing vi3ws dramatically in the first 24hrs Bts Blackpink Twice Remember people More vi3w more money youtube had to pay I don t exactly know how they count the vi3w but for sure those group fandom i mentioned did suffered the same a nctzens Vi3w freezing hour after hour and even got deleted a lot but you know why they still had that incredible amount of vi3ws even when shit happened like this That s because their fandom are huge By huge i literally mean HUGE Increasing the vi3ws is the fandom first goal especially the one that can t support their group with streaming on Korean music site and or buying album So with the strong delicate and that much people ready to str3am all day of course even if many of them didn t know the right way to str3am nctzen is no doubt still yet reach that level Many people assumed that this problem only happened with sm artist no It happened with every video that increased million of vi3ws in the first hour especially with music video However video with low vi3ws under 1000 vi3ws didn t seem to get applied the same rule a the high vi3ws one i heard some said that you can watch half the video but youtube could still count yours a one vi3w Ridiculous i know but with trending mv nowadays where billion of vi3ws aren t seem hard to get example despacito they will do everything to stop increasing the vi3w After all more vi3ws more money

Jowenseul lover	레드벨벳도 그렇고 nct도 그렇고 이번 앨범은 왜 다 양산형 아이돌그룹 노래같냐 sm이 다양한 실험음악을 하면서도 와중에 고급스러움이라고 할까 역시나 레드벨벳이다 nct다 하는 확실한 느낌이 있었는데 이번엔 그런걸 못느끼겠어 저번에 디렉터쪽에 논란도 좀 있고 하더니 새로운 디렉터들로 변화라도 있었나 아이돌 성적은 이번앨범이 아니라 이전 앨범이 얼마나 좋았느냐에 따라 팬덤이 커져서 결과가 나오는 건데 이번 성적이 좋다고 이런 앨범이 좋은걸로 착각하면 안된다 이러다간 엑소도 그냥 그런 노래들 들고 나오는거 아닌가 모르겠다
z _yeon	이럴거면 태일 끼지 말던가 워어어어 이것만 시키고 끝내네 심지어 개인컷 5초 될런지 몰라 보컬하는 애 데리고 이상한 노래만 내고 진짜 환멸난다

Yu Eira	Everyone Just 5 hour if can make 4M
Esther Ramirez Anton	Korean ver and English ver both are awesome
Jessica Tan	Lets winwin yall
Yuju YuBeauty	My bias is Lucas my sexy boi🔥then mark heachan win win and pretty much entire nct dream 😂but to be real I believe there is not so much YouTube ha removed or frozen the view on this video maybe 1mil view extra but not more the reason is because this song didn t go well with the Korean fan I m not saying they hate it but let s be honest this song is so American with all the brrrraa skrraa whoo whoo in the background I would not call this kpop at all If you guy know what I mean Kpop boy singing super typical American produced song Don t get me wrong I love nct but this didn t make success with Korean fan they will support nct a usually but the lack of view is showing

Mochi baby	Luvs💓
Manar Itkaidek	I hate YouTube
Michelle :3	I refuse to believe that regular only got 2 million view Loads of nctzen including me have been streaming all day or a much a possible but to see this result is annoying Also when I went to sleep it wa on 993k and when i woke up it wa only just 1 million view Anyway we can still help them by voting for them buying their album and just by supporting them
IceX25X	Why must you be this hot Taeyong
leny rodrigues	i really liked more when there wa only 7 member af
서지원	역대급이다
Made Sri	WTF it still 2M Is it really youtube hate NCT or what How come the 24 hour just got 2M I and the other Nctzen are definitely streaming from morning to night for our idol but what We are not small fandom Our idol is not a failed product SM we are trying desperately but you are arbitrarily defeating it How stupid
Yoda Universe	DAAAAAAAADDIIIIIIIIIEEEES 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BOOMING SYSTEM UP UP	I have an app that monitor the playlist i viewed 3 mv are in it and the view in that playlist is already at 600 meaning i alone already viewed this vid 200 time that ’ s why i don ’ t believe this BS Youtube stop deleting our view 😭😭😭 also i ’ m using 2 device with 2 different playlist 😢 PS the app ’ s name is YT Studio

Nabila Shahbudin	the song suck
Shannon Butler	What I liked about this one wa that they sounded so much more confident cuz they re doing it in Korean Y know Don t get me wrong the English one is great and it s amazing that they did that but this one just had more power I guess
Renita Nozaria	Y all deserve so much more but it okaaaaay cause you cant rush thing you want to last forever let continue the journey together fighting haeyadwae nct 127 💪 sending my love to all of you💚💚💚💚💚
WhenyoulovemultipleKgroups	If you check the Music Bank performance I couldn t react there that s why I m here lol and you ignore the line distribution then screentime wise everyone ha their own moment except Jungwoo so actually I wa quite happy with that live stage I also think this music video is better than the English one because I kind of had the feeling there is it wa Mark TY backup dancer vocal
N Yuta	Winwin serving visual 💚
Therese Tronga	i ’ ve been gone for the past few day with no internet so i haven ’ t been able to stream i ’ ve used data and watched a few time but i don ’ t want to use a lot of it whenever i have access to wifi i watch the mv a many time i can luckily i ’ m going home tomorrow and you bet i ’ ll start streaming properly

Gel25	Wow Antis are reporting this video Are you that scared that NCT will someday dominate the world
MithunOnThe.Net	SM better learn from how they messed up the NCT concept and avoid repeating the same mistake with their next girl group successor to SNSD Just KISS keep it simple stupid Super Junior whom I love racked up more view than NCT with One More Time which show how le popular NCT really is universally As much a I am a second gen fan Super Junior and SNSD can not carry SM forever Red Velvet are SM s only new success story NCT hasn t even matched the level of success EXO achieved in just one year since debuting EXO were huge by the time they released Wolf and Growl You fangirls can blame YouTube all you want but the truth is NCT is just a messed up concept and the song selection although great in case like Boss and Limitless aren t a mainstream a Koreans like it
Naiixu	i ve been streaming almost for a full 24 hour and we re only at 2M i feel like a failure that i can t give NCT the love and attention they deserve Yall let atleast get them to a win Don t let them flop with this beautiful album
Kyungsoo Loves	I wished SM upload music video on their respective artist channel I dont know But the view here on this channel get stuck always

Q	I know most of you just wan na enjoy this song but I can t help but notice this comeback is still related close to their concept Here are some theory at 0 10 Jungwoo just landed but from where From NCT U In Eng MV Jungwoo stand infront of few tall building at 0 03 Seem familiar This building scene is parallel to Boss He flew from NCT U to NCT 127 So now Jungwoo ha arrived completing 1 2 7 will there be more limitless member add up to NCT127 Prolly NO Because at 3 36 the car they drove thru the tunnel is now outside and in Eng MV at 3 30 they ve shown driving the same car out from tunnel Remember the tunnel that wa seem endless in Limitless They found their way out Putting an end to limitless So at 1 52 where the fuck Winwin is jumping to NCT China of course In case you re still not surprise yet primary color of yellow blue and red were used almost in every scene in this MV NCT Origin Yeah I m losing all my braincells again

Blue Cassie	I think it increase slowly because there are only fewer people watching this compared to other mv I also do not think it because hater report this video this video only ha 2k dislike while other could have more than 20 30k dislike Well I really hope that someday NCT 127 will be bigger they have talent and also work hard What they do not have is only one thing equal distribution of the line on a song If dreamies can have equal line distribution in We Go Up I hope nct 127 can also have that

dearvalerie	Hello NCTZENS Let u continue to support our boy Str m properly Here s how Sign in using your yt acct Watch at least in 360p DO NOT SKIP AD Watch until the end of the music video YT volume must at least be more than 50 Delete history and cooky from time to time Do not hit the replay button Otherwise your view will not be counted The view count will freeze because YT will consider it a spam You can make a playlist But put it on loop and shuffle Then add at least two other music video Streaming manually is still better though But when you are busy you can just use playlist Thank you so much for reading This is a big comeback for NCT Streaming their mv and their album to be released later this 6pm KST is the least that we can do a fan They worked hard a lot especially for this comeback We should give back our love in return Again pls support our boy Lovelots 💚

Andrea Orpiada	I love how both the English Korean version of “ Regular ” had different vibe like it ’ s the same song but in different language but they were kinda so different Like people have pointed out that the English version is more showy because of the audience they ’ re trying to appeal to while the Korean is more toned down than the other one I totally love how NCT 127 wa able to show somewhat different concept with one song I ’ ve gotten used to the English version that this kinda sounded strange to me so I ’ ve been singing incorrectly while trying to sing along lmao Anyways ANOTHER MASTERPIECE FROM NCT

Hang Nguyen	Streaming for NCT seems so much harder than before right We didn t have to struggle this much with We go up 😞 Is it because NCT doesn t have the public recognition so ppl wouldn t bother to listen to their music Or is it because the fan are lazy this comeback I know this comeback is extremely important for NCT it will probably decide whether NCT is a hit or miss to Korean ppl so I ve been streaming a much a I can I only stopped at 3am and woke up at 5 to continue the work I m feeling stressful right now doe anyone want to talk I don t want to hear that the view are not important anymore because to me and I think even to the boy it is important

dani a	The English lyric weren ’ t that deep and felt a bit choppy so I wa ready for the Korean version to slap but it feel like SM focused to much on how it will sound to the new US market and didn ’ t think about if the song flowed smoothly or the line distribution wa good I couldn ’ t just sit and listen to it easily also finally Johnny got some line and I saw Winwin for more than two second wow

vier/pm	this production is so perfect must have been so expensive but it wa worth it sometimes i feel like nct is almost too perfect though too smooth so no one talk shit about it and cause a big uproar nor doe anyone get so excited by the melody to hype it like crazy like momoland s bboom bboom for example this is not hate just an observation i hope sm succeeds to make them their top seller since the boy really deserve it they must work so hard

Dan Andrew Emelo	I think the reason why a lot of NCTzens don t str m NCT MVs is because of the annoyance they feel got from seeing Taeyong Mark most of the time Like hello SM you currently have 10 member from the 127 unit Try to be a little fair for the screen time for the line distribution and for the center position duh 😒 EDIT Censored a word sorry PS Don t hate me peep I m a loyal NCTzen not even a multi fandom I just feel so sad for my ultimate bias Winwin for being unfairly treated even ever since 127 s debut two year back then I do hope you all get my sympathy coz I think all Winwin stans out there do

Liza Kingg	OMG seriosly guy stop complaining about line distribution We got it it s not fair but you are going too far You can t expect all 10 member to have the same amount of line and screen time in a 3min song Plust if you pay attention this is fair Yes Taeyong and Mark had the most screen time and line coz obviously it s a hip hop song and others can t pull of their part a good a these two can but Doyoung and Taeil even tho they didn t have much screen time they got lot of line they were basically singing the whole chorus Jaehyun had fair line and screen time Haechan had his time to shine a well If you watch the English and Korean ver you ll notice that Jungwoo had another part a well plus he stand out in the mv And those who didn t have much line like Johnny Yuta and WinWin had a lot of screen time SO overall there s nothing much to complain If you are a real NCTzen you wouldn t like the comment section to be full with complains and negativity The song is a bop enjoy it

Faelix folk	WINWIN YOU RE SO AMAZINGG
multed	Honestly both MVs were really great yes I know that they used the same scene for some part but there were scene that were in different part a the vid a well a new scene but I prefer this one The Eng Ver MV focused more on the aesthetic while in this one it really highlight the member and focus on them As for the certain scene being in different part of the vid I really like how they placed them because imo the transition were much smoother not rlly sure if this is the word I m looking for lmao a opposed to the Eng Ver and I really like that In the Eng Ver everything in the MV seemed to happen v fast which gave it a more powerful not sure if this is the right word to describe again lol impact and also complimented the whole aesthetic there On the other hand this version wa more chill yet it still keep that powerful impact I wa thinking that maybe I found this ver different from the other because I m used to the other ver but I played the Eng Ver while this MV wa playing and what I found out wa that this MV doe seem more chill Like it still ha that impact like I said before lmao I m starting to use like a lot sdkljakjfd but it s just more chill lol I m being repetitive It s most likely because it compliment the language Korean they re singing here It s the same song but when sung in different language it give off different vibe causing difference in the MVs the feeling it give off and the actual difference If you compare the Eng translation of the Korean Ver to the actual Eng Ver the Eng Ver boast the idea of being rich and living that rich life while the Korean Ver also point out the value of who they are a a person and is a tad bit humbler ex Ice out both my wrist now I can barely see the time v To all the people that dropped me please stop hitting my line Hopped out the coupe the sky is the roof my whole team ball We never lose hundred all blue we do what we do v I fly to the sky paint painting in my mind we never lose Surpassing the limit we do what we do Overall it s up to personal preference which MV or Ver one like I just wanted to give my opinion which prolly don t make sense lol out since Regular is such a bop and the MVs were v interesting to watch

lmlttae	why doe the korean one sound better than the english
Lisva Yunani	😍
MGZ13 XD	The Korean ver sound more like the afterthought with how weird the word and rhythm go with the beat and melody and I don t think it ha anything to do with This is the first time I ve heard of a K pop song that actually sound weird in it default version and that s 99 opposite since K pop is Korean therefore it s alright if it sounded a bit weird in other language like English It s clear that this song with it melody and the beat wa primarily intended for NCT s promotion in the US What I also don t get is why the Seoul division of NCT which is 127 is promoting in the US rather than debuting their American division or having NCT U do it I thought 127 wa the unit in charge in Korea or am I wrong I dunno not an avid NCT fan but yea
Id626. portal1	😍😍😍😍

꧂ bearbear Boy ꧂	This i sooo akward to me because im so used to the english to me
Blooming Days	I saw lot of people complaining on the english ver that the line distribution wa not fair Since I m not used to them speaking in english it wa mark and ty voice that stand out the most but listening to this korean version I think the line distribution is somehow fair They gave the rap part to those best at it it obviously a trap song heavily laced with rap and you can hear everyone during the part where they harmonize And for me that s also called a line even though you share it with someone After all they are a group It s only natural that they sing in chorus It s just my opiniom though

Jeno Jam Kookies/ Joshua TrAsH	You guy don t seem to understand that there s dancing too Sure they don t get many line but don t be so quick to judge Maybe SM and they member are still figuring out which role they play in group maybe SM is being unfair and giving them unequal line distribution but that doesn t give you the right to start complaining about how some member get more than others when you don t know all the information when NCT 127 is a hip hop based group I think when there are 2 out of ten people that are rapper in this clearly more rap based song and when the member are working hard to fulfill their part It s not right to just jump to conclusion like that

Katie Brandenburg	Honestly I appreciate the work idol put in when they release English version of song but I consistently prefer the Korean version to the English version I just feel like it seems to flow better and be more comfortable with the beat instead of translating lyric and then trying to fit them to the music they can just focus on the flow the feeling and the meaning they want to convey

sabrinami	Every single one of you I m so fucking DONE of keeping quiet The line distribution is pure SHIT and another reason why NCT isn t a well off a SM want them to be if they just promote 2 member the stans of the other member keep getting frustrated and won t give their 10000 for the future comeback anymore So yes speaking up IS important and if you wan na come at me and say that I should wait and that my bias maybe will MAAAAYHAPS get line in the future Well FUCK YOU Johnny ha been with this shithead of a company for 10 DAMN YEARS and he still get just to mumble some word in EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEIR COMEBACKS and ISN T EVEN INCLUDED IN THEIR B SIDES Also if you stan one of the well promoted and priviledged member you absolutely have no saying in this You don t know the struggle of watching your bias not even getting a single line Of course we are PISSED and I have reached a LIMIT here Yes I like NCT and I wan na support them but the way Johnny is treated CONSTANTLY during their comeback make me feel tired and way le excited If SM would fix their damn shitty line distribution they wouldn t lose ANYTHING but they can t do that since they can t jump over their shadow and god forbid that Taeyong doesn t sing half of the song EVERY SINGLE TIME DEAR GODNESS So I m gon na keep being loud about the line distribution and let out my frustration and no one of you gon na stop me

AcTUaLLy ITs AbOUt mY siSTeR my OWn siSTeR yES - ty	For people who keep complaining about the line distribution i believe this Korean version wa quite fair considering this is a fast paced hip hop song so it only make sense that Taeyong and Mark will get the most line Can we please stop complaining and wait till the full album come out Cause the regular version of the album contains mostly slow ballad song so maybe the vocalist will get the most line Also I know y all mad at sm but the way some of you are leaving comment on Taeyong and Mark it honestly hurt seeing those Imagine how they d feel if they saw such comment Stop saying Taeyong and Mark stole the lyric FYI they didn t steal It s not their fault that they have most of the line They literally did what wa handed to them smh

HunteR BerserkeR	Regular Korean Ver is the REALITY and Regular English Ver is the DREAM Read and understand the lyric of each version then you ll get the connection between the two version For a short explanation the Eng ver is about blindly chasing money and other materialistic thing while the Korean ver say don t blindly chase money but focus on being our unique self and chase their ambition in connection to the group s original identity The album concept dream v reality is exceptionally well thought of

Svlene	Regular Korean Ver is the REALITY and Regular English Ver is the DREAM Read and understand the lyric of each version then you ll get the connection between the two version For a short explanation the Eng ver is about blindly chasing money and other materialistic thing while the Korean ver say don t blindly chase money but focus on being our unique self and chase our ambition in connection to our group s original identity The album concept dream v reality is exceptionally well thought of

Keythax Bagcat Yu	Honestly i felt a little bit strange when I heard this I mean the korean version I keep on playing the english version and that version is for me is more swaggy and sexy than this korean version jut based on my opinion maybe because I wa used to the english ver since I keep on playing that from time to time but this one I m happy too because I think the screen time of each member is fair the line of jungwoo are increasing even jaehyun got more screentime And yuta winwin too He wa in the center and I saw him singing the chorus No doubt this will gain more view than the eng version since all of them got fair screentime and the line of the vocal increased

cloud ha	if anyone s asking if there s a difference between the korean and eng vers of regular there definitely is especially with the lyric the lyric of the korean vers of regular aren t a flashy or flexing it s understated toned down and ha more grit the lyric are a lot more about nct s ambition root and identity rather than material achievement and money it s a huge difference compared to the eng version lyric i hope people check out the korean lyric when lyric video come out or if sm put in subtitle and lyric into the m v rather than people automatically assuming they re singing the same thing in the eng vers but in korean instead the difference and the meaning behind regular is well suited for their dream v reality concept i can t wait to listen to their whole album that tell a story

Matt Obra	I ve noticed SM is going all out in their western style this past few year This is what competition can do this company will never resort in doing this music style at all if BTS never became famous But here they are being forced to release music style that most international fan can enjoy more than local korean fan This is like 90 percent american hip hop style and just 10 kpop I really hope BTS will be more famous than they are so that this company will be pressed over and over again and by this they will continue to create quality music
