BLOODY FACE band & records official youtube channel	*In my mind, getting rid of the fancy glitz stage set up*........ Now, i can say that it sounds good as music live! Tight and powerful! The studio version, which is great, is still one of the cool bright spots on the sellout black album!
Egor Shpak	Metallica is great

Flammora74	I was there for this one!! I Love Metallica!!!!
scrubl0rd	The tone and the down tuning honestly don't make it sound good here. Sounds a bit too mushy and not so heavy.

Максим Филатов	1:10 Оглянись, 8 рублей!

M. Kawiasiketc	Better song
J-Dawg	They still got it \m/
underspon	LOVE
RyderGuy	This was my first Metallica concert and I remember hearing those first 3 notes and immediately recognizing what it was and literally screaming in excitement (as I did for about the first half of the show)
William Poire	I know their singles from this album were the most popular, but this was always my favorite. I remember just playing this song repeatedly while stargazing. And this was in the days of cassette tapes.   I hope they play it in Tulsa (if Lars is reading this!)
Frisch Regen	all of this was and will be
C21H30O2	that moustache always maked Hetfield sound better
guillermo herrera	Dónde esta la guitarra de james rayos la escondió
Toronto Hoodman	Ya this one of those Metallica songs that I can say is complete shit.
tuncelcel	00:37 93'
Félix Tinay	Guatemala ! Like !
Jessie Walker	Now James should just let that mustache grow up and around up into the sideburns,  handlebar beard black album style,  was his coolest look, all joking aside this song sounds killer
Дмитрий Самойленко	Any noise where readable guitars? Bring back my favorite band
Skippy Farnsworth	Thank you Metallica for letting us fans listen to your great music on YouTube. Some of us live in places where we will have a slim to none chance of ever seeing you guys in concert. I speak for many in saying thank you for sharing with us, your fans of your great music.

Ambrosio Santos	I was there live and in person!!!!  Going to see them in Raleigh too!!!
BladeOfRebellion	Oh man, this one was such a surprise to me! Like all throughout the intro, I was wondering what song this was, until the main riff hit and I was like "Oh shit!" And it sounded SO FUCKING HEAVY!!
Tony Stark	*We need: (full) No Remorse, Trapped Under Ice, The Thing That Should Not Be, Disposable Heroes, Eye of the Beholder, The Frayed Ends of Sanity, Dyers Eve, The Struggle Within (extended intro and post-solo riff), Ain't my Bitch, Wasting My Hate, Devil's Dance, Bad Seed, Prince Charming, Attitude, FIXXXER, Frantic, St. Anger, The Unnamed Feeling, That Was Just Your Life, The End Of The Line, All Nightmare Long, The Judas Kiss, SUICIDE & REDEMPTION, My Apocalypse, Here Comes Revenge, Lords of Summer, Ronnie Rising*

Евгений Иванов	👏🏻
Communismisgod	I was at this concert best decision ever.
Steven	Robs backing vocals are getting better and better. Was not a big fan of it in the beginning but know I kinda dig them, what an improvement! And obviously he is a bass god.
Jason Mogensen	Nasty just Nasty \m/
Blackarps	Missed this concert due to real life problems!  Looks like it was a great one as always!
PablometaL	BRUTALL ESTA VERSION!!!!!! SE ME PUSO LA PIEL DE GALLINA!!!VIVA METALLICA!!!...
Mandarin	Одно по одному исполняют🤣
Kallenh Mungarro	Barça-Madrid: 5-1... I love Metallica
Blaack	Really tired voice James :(
Fonzy Brookestone	Song jams!!! The fellas are sounding great! Anyone know what's up with James' picking hand? His guitar seems a bit higher too, maybe that's throwing off his picking? I think his guitar was raised from the REAL low stance due to his neck?
Macrov	I lost it when this started! An amazing show!!!!!!!
Arun Bissoon	That 🅱ASS tho😍
Samantha Cox	One of my favorite songs off of the black album. ^_^ 🤘🏻😈🤘🏻
metfan4l	This song will forever remind me of how they named their 2013 movie Through the Never and *DIDN'T PLAY THE SONG!* (Still an awesome performance though.)
James Row	Reeks of POWER!!!
William Raymond	Came to the comments to see how much people had picked Lars’ playing apart. Probably a lot as usual.
Rudy Black	James put on some weight.   Idk if its from lifting weights or the spoon tho.  Hard to tell lol..
emiliano Gimenes j balvin	Metalica for ever 😎🔥🔥🔥❤🎶
Giovanni Coscia	A big wave of rock
Matt Bird	See Lars plays those triplet fills at the beginning awesome. All he would need to do is try just a little harder on One and Moth and he'd be amazing. I find him lacking and cutting corners on some things. It's like bro you're Lars Ulrich believe in yourself and if you fuck up just say "Van Halen" like Dime and Vinnie would say.
J Maynez	Man. Kickin all kinds of ass lately.
Kaka Oliveira	VAI KARAI 💀💀💀💀🎶🎶🎶🎶
Vivian Stanshall	WHO HERE IS WAITING?....

Тарас Емец	Обернись!Восемь рублей!
leo villa	Welcome back James from 1992,is good to see you again
Dimitri Drapeau-Gervais	The days where Hammett holds his guitar lower than Hetfield...
Anulu	They have started the song exactly the same as in London a year ago. Come on guys, you can be better than that.
Алекс Бах	заебись!
Roger Braswell Jr.	Dammit they sound good. I shoulda went
Max Frey	Great performance of a very nice song, please play such dep cuts more often!! :-)
ChronoWind	james ur ot 20 anymore that mustache is a no
Dylan Lambeth	I was there front row. Sick Show 🤘🏻

Schlong Duck Dong	I was supposed to be at this show but had to change it to the Jan. 28th show in Raleigh but I plan to be there Hell or high water!!! I've been trying to see them since 96 Lollapoolza in Rockingham been a fan since I was bout 8 or 9 years old
Sergey Epikhin	Awesome! You make great show. Great sound, great band! Tnx! Metallica #1in universe!

ANOTHER GAMING CHANNEL	Most underrated song ever
Jaymz Metalfield	Amazing performance!! Especially the last part: "Nevaaahhh" close to the 90s. Btw This is me "Rick Grimes S5" using my other channel. Maybe some of you remember me. (I don't know what's going on with youtube but for some reason my comments disappear on metallica's latest vids).

Steve Drouillard	damn it in Milwaukee We Got The Unforgiven, would have totally rather had Through The Never. Or for that matter of wolf and man, God who failed, struggle within, don't tread on me, holier-than-thou, yeah that about covers it
Konsta ntinos	Χυστερό ακόμα και μετά απο τόσα χρόνια...
Urly 666	Quizas me considere el fan numero 1 de esta banda. Ahora creo que ha llegado el momento de retirarse como los mejores... El que es critico constructivo lo entendera. Los demas se pueden ir a la concha de su madre.
Jon Bohr	bass sounds beastly!!!

Wojtek Cymerys	I'm going to see them live for the second time next year!!! This time in the legendary Slane Castle and they're going to play Whiskey in the Jar, Which ironically not being their song, started my life-long obsession with the band (picking up from my dad) and is the very song which made me realise I must play the guitar changing my life forever in the process!! I will love them through the never and back! \m/
Doğukan İşcen	Metallica is the best youtuber ever :)
Vojislav Ninkov	Metallica full adrenalin'!!!!!!*****
Alexander Tinneny	It's weird that I was at this concsrt
Perkele	*WAH.*
b b	More LOAD and RELOAD SONGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ENBAuto	Hey, I was at this one.
Everton Schmidt	Please debut more songs from the last album aswell ​😎
Albert Stinnett	See in March at Sprint center
Temmy9	i mean, Its nice to have premieres its just that its a short video but still a great way to hype it up!
Dejoblue	I have started ignoring Metallica's notifications because they are now premiers I cannot watch. It is annoying, overtly commercial, inconvenient, time wasting, bandwidth wasting, and sabotages legitimate notifications.
Lord Kurt	Let's hope Metallica will surprise us by playing Mama Said, Free Speech for the Dumb, The More I See, Ronnie Rising Medley, Beyond Magnetic "complete", Astronomy, Ramones all covers and Motorhead all covers, sometime
maverator	So I click on this but I can't watch it because it's not going to be live for another 91 minutes? I turned off my notifications for a reason, and this basically amounts to an advertisement cluttering up my subscription page. Especially when there are lots of other "premieres" in there too, which I also can't watch. Best case,  I can pick them up in the middle, which is not how I want to be watching these things. So I think this feature is garbage, and I encourage this channel to not do premieres. I am casually subscribed because I'm a big fan and I like to watch these videos occasionally. But I'm not religious about it and this is the kind of thing that pushes me away.
