Mark Bargamento	Is this not Dan Bilzerians house?
Faneco Bang	labor money
Leonardo Corbucci	I filmed on here. Really good investment I do agree. The perfect  "movies set house" to film Hollywood huge colossal movies or create the best events in the WORLD! ...But to live there??!  It feels more like a "Frick show museum" kind of house. For sure not in the Top 10 houses I ever seen in person in the World. Maybe you should turn it down and try again? :) joking, cool, sick place.
Wilcows	Some seriously poor production quality in this video. “Crazy”.   And learn something interesting to say please. Shit.

TWO THOUSAND TWO	So you do not need to get out of the house all you have in it pool cinema car salon room for: meal sleeping games bowling game room for sweets and private heliport airport and of course you do not have to go out of the house in general!
Visual One Studio	As the host says, "insane."
Delta W	Only thing that i have from that mansion is dolby atmos's software on my razer phone,i bet the water there is worth 200k haha
Mehmet Filiz	*When you're super rich you aren't just looking for a place to crash. You're looking for a place to captivate your guests to leverage your reputation and the value of your name by showing off "money is not an obstacle for me"* So hold your horses my fellow below %5 friends.
Nick Fleming	Haha "does the helicopter come with it?" "yep" "got it" what an obvious question
Maxwell Peters	Trading binary option without any experience is like gambling with your money when you can actually employ the skilled professional manager like Franncy who has earned me over $56000 over the last 3 weeks. He can be reached via Email: (Franncyolacamacho@gmail.com)for proper guidance
Gaz Matic	I'll give you $3

Miscellaneous 84	That's "crazy" lmao (250 that's crazy) what better word to describe your amusement. Lol
Allie prinxx	Horrid place. If it was a museum of modern art, fine, but its not a home. Too artificial. The only good thing about it is the exit. You can just see the dollar signs in the salemans eyes.
Joey Victor	Maybe an art gallery, a hotel, yeah a mansion, but not a home.
Marco Pischettola	One word of Serhant: INSANE :)

Robert van Piggelen	So...the sink costs @1.55 costs the same as my house?

Jees Jes	Holy. Fucking. Shit.
lakeem muhammad	This house was way over the top but that’s what happens when money 💰 isn’t a thing to you.
JB11	This is what a lot of money and little sense of comfort will buy you.  In the 1960s an architect would know how to balance high end luxury with comfort and warmth.  This is so far from that it's disappointing.  6/10.
Wayne Davis	Money definitely does not equal taste. You can’t buy class.
joe doe	"MainLine it" yeah he used to be a junkie or still is

Daniel Cooke	Anyone watching this while crying as well?
Kunaak	I cant explain why, but that kinda house would seem more like a prison to me, its seems so lonely to be in such a place.
Herp Derp	Your able to vomit faggy shit like this up on to youtube, but they cant seem to clean the shit and needles off the streets.  Glad to see you got your priorities in order liberal elite Californians.
naveen kataria	They should call it the "Most Expensive house never sold".  It has been on the market for quite some time now and was earlier priced at $250 million I think, if memory serves me. Wonder why no one wants to buy it.
Karel Vysoký	amazing mansion
Eugenia Reed	Jaw Droppingly insane. Dam!!

Kratos Gutierrez	Great crib god bless me with that one please amen.
bitterman co	This isn’t even the nicest mansion, this is the best example of wasting money on stupid shit that isn’t even nice to look at. That vanity was hideous AF and was the cost of a whole house. A big ugly slab of jade. Another cost of an entire house.
JusticeAA	absolutely a stupid insane house. it is crazy

MORGAN ORMROD	You have to answer the door in this house,so many windows
boyneave	Whats the song at the end?
Fleet Simons	i've never been in a house this nuts but i've been in a few that come close. they're fucking depressing. they feel cold and hard and empty. it's not a healthy thing to live like that, and you see it very clearly reflected in the lives of the people who do. again, depressing
Quantum	[IRON-MAN] "Kill Power".....🤤"What Just Happened". 🚁I hope they changed the no fly boarders.
Sovereign Monarchs	Very ugly mansion.
Montpbm Crawford	With all of these people starving in this world people rather have a $188 million home 🏡 smh. Just buy a $1-$10 million dollar home and help people. That's too much to pay for a home. But whatever floats their boat, I personally wouldn't buy that if I could. Just give me a 10,000 square foot home and freedom money 💵 plus enough to help people I'm good. 😊
Ju Be	250 millions ;) ... 924 Bel Air road
Firas Ashak	ok people dont buy a 300M boat ..... ok ? just buy a 100 or less boat and buy a 150M house .... and then i will let u fuck me from my asshole

Ash Kewal	"Worlds fastest electric bike in the world" -.-
Joe Coughlin	This is disgustingly tacky
my31and37	My 188M house would not look like that one.  They got taken on the staircase for sure.
NUDY LAND Slimeball 3	That villa price is 250million not 188million
nada farouk	This feels so plastic, don't get me wrong it's beautiful but I wouldn't call that home.
rey024	If I would save all the money I make not spending a dime! I would be able to buy this house in about 5000 years... goals.
The Voice Of Reason	$188 million pile of tasteless shit.

Brock Myers	There's a lot of tacky shit in that house. Great location though
oliverlewisworldwide	Insane

K Neeko	Cute
giulia bertola	So the price dropped by 62 million within one year. In three years you'll se me living there having paid somewhere around 30k
eatadickgoogle+	Millions below the poverty line, hundreds of thousands of homeless individuals... oh and here's a 300 000 washtable... I really cant help but think, someday people are gonna go full on Lous XIV on those asses.
city0166	They get new movies “in house” the night they come out. Being wealthy is so much Cooler than being middle class
Flavius Tech	You accept credit card for this mansion? :)
MsFears	At a certain point it doesn't feel like a house anymore.  It seems like a commercial business. Cool if that's what you like, but I can't live somewhere that doesn't feel like home.
Martopawiro Kimberley	Whoooo owns this insane crib????
Jenny Yonce	2:03 Beyoncé on TV!!😍
George	weird flex but ok
Neo Khesa	WOW this is what you can buy for $255 Million. But it seems so................... busy dosnt it? Am I alone in thinking it feels more like your in a high end office block or hotel? I guess an ordinary mortal like myself could not even conceive of something like this being a home. So much going on other than just....... living space. Again WOW.
Dave Purdy	Hey Ryan! Wow what an amazing property like no other I'm sure and you said 'crazy' 13 times! Lucky 13! Thank you!
Miralem Candic	Polished steel staircase 2 million lol I hate shiny stuff
Vorname Nachname	Idiots
Robert Ocampo	I can see Mayweather buying this.
Bojan Ivanovski	And that's the whole POINT
Bernard	Is he actually rich enough to afford this ?
Robertking1996	The builder made a terrible decision dumping this money into 1 house. They would have been better served building multiple homes for $10 million a piece.
Jack	tacky
Aiden Blades	Unreal. Give me a 1000 square foot cabin in the woods with a fireplace and Slove and give me peace. The money I dont use will go to donations
Fernicus Maximus	They might as well be picking gold from the street.
jdareyah	House cost about $2 - 5 million to build, but because it is Beverly hills and in "prime part of town" it is $188 million, also paying salaries, commissions, markup, marketing cost etc.
Pootz_	I could maybe afford a lightbulb from this house
Johnny Boii	Bruh that’s like how I dreamed my home to be... can’t wait to build somthing like this from scratch

Shantae Latrese	Simply Beautiful.... breath taking.
Jamie Simpson	Kylie Jenner could buy 4 of these
Sam Tomich	weird flex but ok
MIKE	That's Dan Bilzerian's house lol
Tesheng Liao	This isn't a house it's a hotel, it gives off a really lonely feeling, i'd much rather buy a house with good neighbors and community.
Chillest Bill	What the hell are normal people like us supposed to think when we see places like this....
Mynameisweirdoss	And here I am with a negative balance and $1100 of my shit stolen :/ rich douchebags

Soda Cups	How does air conditioner work in that place 😂😂😂
Dil. Plays247	whats the point of all this ? you'll die one day eventually. Just live a normal decent life with less ambitions and desires so when you're dying you know you're dying without anything leaving behind but love and prosperity
46Genes	This is what i would built for my guests.. that i dont like.
P- o-rtability	Sure, insane, crazy, sure, insane,crazy...
Darubah	Tasteless, tacky and "modern" are the words that immediatly come to mind. 2Mil. staircase that looks like it's a 5$ bargain find. Sorry to break it to you, but Louis Vuitton does not equal good taste. The entire house sadly screams made envisioning what someone would spend close to 200million $ on. But the polished steel doesn't invite anyone, it's just like buying a hospital. Sterile and unpersonal. If i had 200mil to spend on a house i'd most definately just pass through this in 5min and go: nah.
T Kh	Even if someone is worth more than a 100 billions, I still don't get it why would anyone want to live in that freaking mansion!! It really is not meant to be occupied by a person. It's cool to shoot movies inside it though.   Anyway, I guess capitalism also has its own downs sometimes. What a waste of capital indeed... Sad!
jordan miller	imagine the ping you would get on fortnite
JREVY22	Hey that’s my house get out! Lol jk

Cendella	so this guy is just casually SO RICH with, bad editing, horrible audio like whats going the fuck on LOL
Daniel Martino	it would be more interesting if the host knew literally anything about the subject matter. He just walks around saying "crazy"
Mick Mack	What a load of superficial shite ,I wouldn’t buy this even if I had the money , there’s no prizes for being ripped off ,you would have to be a complete moron to spend that amount of money on that house just because it’s filled with fancy massively overpriced toys ,champagne fire extinguishers.....what a bellend
Jason Duffy	Santa, I want this plz.
harbinger200	It seems money cant buy taste, but it sure can make this kind of bullshit 21 bathrooms with 800.000 sink(???). Did your 40 closest friends all run for a shit at once?
Join Division	Bernie Sanders house!
Dan 123	If you conquer the world, then you deserve this house.
Retro X Doobies	I remember when it was $250,000,000 😂

D Rodriguez	safe to say i'll never have anything close to this

dageek1000	Ok , call me when it will worth 200 000 USD
Max Lundstroem	You buy this, and 3 months later, all this stuff is gonna be 'like whatever'
BILLIONAIRE MYMATRIX	One would be blinded on a sunny day from the GLARE off everything doors included shellac city ...looks like a mall hall in Vegas... I guess you can buy 40 closest friends too.
Al Y	924 Bel-Air Rd, Bel-Air, CA 90077. I am sure there are people who like the entire package. but then for house itself. its just run down a bit.  too much ornament and toys killed the house.like people wearing too much jewelry loses its shine. too much. like camera in the middle of room. sure guy who trys to sell it likes it but not many dig it.  I say get rid of all . sell the "house"  itself. its like trying to sell  certain type of dept. store .(not everyone likes). its asking for a very specific type of buyer. Prob. worth 100 tops.  helicopter you cant even fly out of that house what good is it.  house looks like toy store.  very pretentious setup. No offense but too much "stuff"  loses all the greatness of house.  all cramped into a tight space. house like this belongs in hundreds of acres land. not like this. this kind of set up does not belong in that hill. the beauty of it I think is the view and peaceful nature and grand. NOT some corner store with expensive pretentious toys.
Jeremy Lelea	Did all the house staff have the day off that you only see yourself and the other guy?
M. H.	No, thanks
Drewbles	Imagine buying that but not having enough left to pay for a cleaner or you're just too tight to, one week and dust everywhere. Yeh be cool to own something like that but greed, the kinda people who can afford this don't give a shit about the average joe, they would get away with murder no problem
The Void	crazy...insane...crazy...insane...crazy...insane...crazy...bonkers!?!...insane...crazy...insane.
Wojtek Garstka	Dan Bilzerian didint bought it ?
Mercury Gaming	20 good ole cheap labor working at 5$ an hour for 3hrs a day on a single staircase. Plus Holiday and PTO seems legit
Joe D'Amico	188 million dollar mansion in libtard california, and yet the streets are filled with shit, go figure
Gabensy	Egos
Rob The Snake Man	"insane"
DodderingOldMan	I can understand the appeal of a massive, luxurious mansion, but... I really don't want to meet the sort of person who'd buy this place... Seriously, cases made out of stone? A giant gilded camera? A massively expensive piece of jade just hanging there?   And most baffling to me... what rich person wants a house that comes with fifty cars? Isn't the pleasure of car collecting in the acquisition? Would it mean anything at all to you if you just moved into a house and they were all sitting there already on display?
didi48316	Happiness lies not in gold and esate. Happiness dwells in the soul.  Democritus
Tokyo Warfare	Tbh. It feels overpriced.

RockRocker45	Kasabian Club Foot
Jack Baudean	89 times
Yaseen Saad	lol i have like 10 of these ....... in gta v
j ross	The staircase is worth my house, my two cars, my 401k, my pension fund and my dog.
Scholar Of Babylon	Make's you feel sick and if it doesn't then you should probably think long and hard about who you are as a person.
LadyVenom Way	Holy crap that place is amazing, I can give you 10 dollars for it lmao anyone wanna hit me up with the rest hahahah
Anthony Williamson	Lol what a waste of money and poor designer. It will never sell... Bad artwork and bad ,, everything... blah..

ThyerHazard	I wonder how close to this you could get without the uselessly expensive crap, IE the 2 mill stair case 55k anchor and disgusting honey stone crap. there is probably 120million dollars of crap in this house
DonnieToTheMoon	A house only a Jeff Bezos could love
CME-LFT	All this money and not one game arcade room?

arwin sanjuan	This is so amazing
Monkeyman	If I’m not mistaken this property was worth $250 million not many years back and now it’s $188 million. Not the great investment the guy said it was at the beginning is it.
Blake Flexin	WHO THE HELL IS BRUCE , AND WHERE CAN I GET ONE OF THESE ?
TheLast Cipher	This is outrageous. It's unfair.
xpez	Putting a tv outside in the yard is beyond garish.. This place is designed like a las vegas hotel..  ugh.
Jakrabat	I saw a bunch of so called ”art”, but wasn’t shown as much of the actual house 😐  Not impressed of some guy carving brand rip-offs out of expensive rock and a bunch of other ”expensive” stuff.  I’d like to ser the actual house; the rooms, the design and the architecture.
Michael Moretti	$188 million house ... but they can't turn the fucking music down during the promo video.
Franco Salis	Doesn’t Franklin live there?
D' Jackson after	The most exciting part of the tour to me is "Airwolf".  Those glancing shots could have benefited from the original theme.  It is beautiful, but key features are missing.  The A-Team should be able to whip it into shape in about 120 seconds.
wnxdafriz	you know.... california ironically is probably the only place where you could pay the property tax for a place like this.....    1.88 million a year
Derek Johnson	"residential real estate out pays the dow jones and s&p 500" This is a lie. On average, residential real estate averages a 7.5% while s&p averages 9.14%.
VULTUSPRIME	No one mentions the fact that it is an unbelievably ugly house.
Pranab Karki	waiting for zombie apocalypse to happen so I can stay in this house
Jason S	Think how many people  you could help  instead of wasting money on all this bull sh*t....and still live humbly and comfortably for the rest of your life
Just Imagine	Belle Aire - When you see the sign... it screams top of the hill.  I was even more impressed with the Belle Aire sign than the Beverly Hills sign.  And yes, I would have to have a driver in LA.
dave marnell	Whose Brian?
Michael Tang	Insane. -said every 10 seconds.
KOBKED-X	did not watch, will not .. the decadence is so overwhelming it turns my stomach.  188 million for this "person" to store items and impress shallow people... win/fail ratio is 0/10
RONNYfromOZ	The owner of this house must have a tiny dick.
KangTa9	insane
Libery One	WOW what a view, you can see SMOGGY , sh*tty LA. All for 188 million.....sick!

easside landlord	I'm in love. 🤗🤗🤑🤑🤑
Kyle Osnack	The "expert" your interviewing only knows half facts about most of the items he speaks about. No such thing as diamond bronze or hunter obsidian. I'm stopping the video at 2 false facts within 2 mins :p
Games/ Video's	How is this house less expensive than the worlds most expensive car.
Ace van	i can do $7.50, take it or leave it (please take it)

Leela Langston	Update: he now lives in a town called Schitt’s Creek
David Guthrie	This is stupid.  Jz and Beyonce had a place with greater taste.  This is a copy trying to do a one up. Shame. Could of been tasteful instead of f*** garish and boastful.
Lamp Post	That’s crazy
HawtChili	*dead alligator exists*.... beautiful
Mason S	“One of the 50 cars here, there’s about a dozen here” 😂 which is it bud 50 or 12
Mudri	For all those "Noone will buy this" comments: people who can buy this don't waste time on youtube.
The Dog Tutor	DUMBASS KNOWS 2 WORDS
Hobo Final FLASH	this house is a rip off
TheGgreen100	Glad they had a host with such an extensive vocabulary to help with the tour.  I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been told how "crazy" or "insane" or "nuts" every overwrought trinket was in that place.
Daniel Reed	"insane" "that's awesome" "that's crazy"
Deep Healing Space	Drinking Game: take a shot everytime Ryan says "crazy"
Wafi Gaming	2,000 washrooms ... yup
Roger Recker	]my house is better jk omega lul

Honest subscriber	i am disliking this coz i cant buy this🤤
Makjuice	This is Dan Bilzerians house.
Stephen Matesic	All while the lines at the community food bank grow longer and longer. Decadence is an illness.
Hwangchung	Is this Notch's house?
Connor Murray	awful reactions to this amazing place
Pro Fighter	I'd be the first one to take a shit in all 21 bathrooms in two days.
Nikola Jašić	Ryan "Insane" Serhant
povang	I cant imagine the annual property taxes on that thing, and with it being Commiefornia the taxes are crazy high. I live in SC and my 400k+ worth of property milks me for 10k in taxes annually. You'd have to be a a multi billionaire to just break even living in that thing.
Jot Bola	this really humbles you
wacky cujo	Only in America
Hlapeto1	Who the f is Bruce
Anthony Stephen Mendes	Kasabian's Club Foot at the start of the video is a treat!
Austin Welch	He keeps saying “40 of your closest friends” lol
suprarune	It will end up as a ghost house..no one will buy a house for that price or rent it for that matter..
Polar	that swimming pool was bigger than my entire apartment
Have a great day!	I’m sorry but this place is gross. “CRAZY” is right.
getredytagetredy	Blow this decadent POS up NOW....
Zinc Crystal	The only people that will buy that house is people that leave in Dubai,cos for them,the word insane when it comes to materialistic things does not exist
Justin Marchand	Insane
SG Max	So how do I sell my soul to the devil?
MrSkypony	If I hear the camera man say " That's Insane" one more time im going to puke that also goes for "That's crazy" The camera man needs to close his mouth and let the guy give the tours. Very distracting
brian 5	A overpriced sink cost as much as a simple house lmfao
April Artis	This house is freaking insane but I wonder how happy he is with all these expenses items!
Crveni storno	Ugly, soulless, sterile and kitsch...
Cipher160	Just started this and that agent clearly doesn't understand the yachts. 1) They're making money on them year round. Will possibly break even but who cares. It's a fun yacht. 2) The house market is on the verge of popping in the next maybe 10 - 15 years before real estate people just make it too expensive to live like it is for many right now. Shit won't last. Period.
ELOSOLOCO22	The seller mentioned "40 of your closest friends." I only have 3 that I will take a bullet for. Other than that, well they there just for the money.
Hard RIght	That's cool, but does this House have a computer that can run Crysis though?
ninethree	Dan Bilzerian lives there
George Keough	I personally think that house sucked.
Mario Zoisl	For all that money there's something missing. ..warmth ....that looks more like set on a music video. ..that crib ain't cosy. ..
Max	Insaneeeeeeee
MyMadness	And they say money does not buy happiness...
Robert Rotterdam	Jezus Christ, it is sooooo ugly! For all that money you could make some steps in restoring an English Country Estate (without all this nouveau riche shit of course).
someone	Name of the song 8:5?
Hendrik Greve	wait, isn't this dan bilzerians'house?
Michael Schafer	Honestly I would rather have a house in Malibu..... Seclusion and the ocean, this seems more like it caters to the silicon valley crowd.
doc dang	It should worth 400 million
Justin Gannon	5 years ago I wanted to drop out of college,and I did. With the help of this course https://bit.ly/2PBAhQt and my family’s support, I was making more than six figures at the age of 18. Click the link to find out how I made a million dollars in 3 years.
The Dude	This house is over the top. It's not homey at all, it's not grounded, it's sterile and boring for as fancy as it is. This isn't how humans should live. This looks more like a building you'd rent to entertain a bunch of snobby aholes.
KHalifA Suladze	crazy, insane :))
Neil  Anderson	It's over the top and vile.
Jeff Davis	I LOVE LUXURY LISTINGS - and this mansion. Just when you think you've set a goal too big for yourself, you see this thing and your "biggest" goal seems much more obtainable. Thanks!
slash slash	Only stupid person pay soooo much for a house
HaNooo	How many animals lost their lives to build that house?  They don't ask that.  ;)    Human ego and shame.  Excess when others suffer.  Still looks pretty cool in a way too gaudy way.  👍  Seller is damn good at his job.  Hoping for a recession is me and regulation.
DumDum	what happen to the 250M initial price of this house lol. stupiesd house ever , no character no style just a bunch of expensive random shits throw in it to justify the stupid price.
KMPZ	I loved the whole house other than that giant camera... it looked so shit its crazy. I'd sell it right away if I had enough money to buy that house. The rest of it was nice though.
Angelica sweet	wowowwwowoq GOALSSSSS
Kevin	Adjust that collar
timespaice	Crazy Crazy Insane That's Crazy Crazy It's crasy That's Insane Crazy
MC Drex	@1:52 when you say crazy a few times in a row and begin to sound like Tom Cruise in Collateral
KrulliS	thats crazy
270_TO_WIN	So it’s probably a 80 million dollar house with 100 million dollars worth of shit inside it
AbhorrentSpawn666	Imagine having enough money to buy this! 😮
Сергей Волков	Why you didn't show personal zoo?
elliottajoh1	Money does not buy happiness

nine tails	Legend has it that this guy is still walking around the house saying "Insane!...Crazy!...That's crazy!"
Jeff Nicholson	3:15 dudes holding a shitty iPhone it’s not even an iPhone X like god
TVperson1	It really highlights how some super rich people aren't that bright!
Dr Dread	Absolute WASTE of money.........Too Big, UNhomely, Massive maintainance, Large STAFF.........Nah
CNC O	What a stupid idiot, to spend so much money just to get the others attention. What a weak idiot. And btw, go and do a fucking hair transplant, you look ridiculous.
bar10dr	Do more rich home walkthroughs, work on your responses to the guide, you'll be famous.
A VERY horny Mr.Dinosaur	"come back anytime!" -comes back the next day "what are you doing here?" "BUT YOU SAID.."
Ali Reza	half the price of this house is just some useless crap. isn't just cheaper to build your own mansion?
Tonino	I don't want to live in a place like lol
Sarah Welstead	Other than, say, 1 or 2 Saudi Prince/Russian oligarch types, who the heck would be interested in this 'house' as an actual living space? I can see a corporation buying it for entertainment/investment purposes, or someone turning it into some kind of retreat, but who the hell is actually the market for a property with honey onyx replicas of designer bags? That's really not adequately addressed here.
Beardmania	Tear this motherfucker down and build some real houses. An entire neighborhood could be built over this waste of space.
nOsWeaRtHeOnE	Thumbs up if this was CRAZY!
pikiwiki	I don't think they can move this thing. This thing has been on the market for Years
Roberto Legaspi	The man is more of modelling himself.  The only comments ive heard from him is crazy and insane
JORGE HERNANDEZ	I will like to buy it now !!!!
Sid Pablo	I'm watching a $188million dollar video. For free. Minus battery and data and phone price. Oh and time.
hotneo7	I've kept an eye on 924 Bel Air for some time when it initially floated a $250 mil price tag and was featured on all the morning circuits but in this economy to still see it unsold means nobody in America is crazy enough to buy this property, maybe a Chinese billionaire will but never actually spend the night. It's got this fake helicopter on the pad that doesn't fly, no engine, and a massive tv that pops out of the pool area, a James Bond theater and a candy wall. It also comes with 'hard to find' collectors cars but really they are your average supercars. It's a fun house perfect for a hip-hop music video ( if they can insure it) but it's so over the top that the ROI is dicey in this housing bubble.
manfred edilson	for people like Paul allen, 400 million boat living in 25 mil house makes sense because when the 400 million dollar boat becomes 50 million dollar used boat, he can buy a new one like you guy a gum from the 7/11
Etienne STERCQ	I love luxury listings
Gh0stBustaz11	this is the american dream right here

Shadow Heart	I'll accept a $3 mil. home. I'm humble.
javier castaneda	Was the instrumental for Brooklyn baby by Lana del Rey playing?
Richard Simpson	"The worlds fastest electric bike in the world" hahaha
JJDPRO MEDIAPRODUCTION	This is a 10million dollar home with some bling to try to make you think it's worth noth 100 mill. That's all.
Aaron Spurgeon	This house is garbage on account that we were not able to see the master bedroom.
sara paul	Expensive but lacks so much ugh
Mark M	Why doesn't this dic keep saying, "Insane"? Replace the word Insane with Impressive would be more appropriate. Wouldn't you agree?
BrightSideOfLife	Can I just rent the snack room at 10:00
Pandarrow	Lets face it. No one's gonna buy this
reggie bayard	188 MILLION isnt jack diddly considering some lucky mother fucker just won 1.6 BILLION dollars in the last megamillions not to long ago
sledrelics	This home actually comes with air wolf. Sold!
ezekiel1238	Tfw you realize you will never make anywhere near a percentage of this in your entire lifetime
Kinjal Brahmbhatt	What does this man do for living?
ThatGuy	project 8 vibes w that song
Neo Guy	This world is really  messed up, and those two douche bags love it.
Keith Krieger	188 million dollar home for one greedy asshole smh one tenth of the cost of that home could've helped 1000s of starving kids. buy a nice comfy home and use the other 187 million to help end poverty
Rene Laureano	Did I just see a needle full with ice? 🤦‍♂️
varun singh	many of the things in this house are useless, nothing but expensive just to show off!
Philippe Turgeom	I mean this is just a big waste of money. I understand buying a bigger house because more and money and what not, but I when will anyone need that house, have the money to buy it, or be in the area to get the house. Literally, Bill Gates' house is cheaper than this.
adrianor31	It's a $188M Mansion and you need to use the stairs? No elevator?
Gawee Fab	I generally don't want to live in that house, ever. It's too fucking luxurious. It's just an unnecessary investment.
MrFreshomie	It will take me like 30 years to run away from this mansion.
Johnny Dang	Sales person: *3 paragraph explanation on the significance of a certain part if the house* Ryan: *Generic one word response*
justitek	is either me or that bold dude from the side reminds me of Stan from The Golden Girls?
Scavenger	Surprised this isn’t on Million Dollar Listing New York.
Arseny	A little suggestion for the Expert home designers in the comments all of a sudden.   1: Stop saying the person of the house has bad taste. Taste is subjective to the individual.  2: Stop saying "I would never buy expensive shit if that were my mansion."  Money changes even the purest of people.   3: Stop looking like fucking idiots.   4: Listen to my beautiful music :)
shelly mmadu	owner has no taste whats so ever., a house worth 188 mill i was expecting to see an airport to say the least
ilfromdaville	someone send this to the mega millions winner
H G	Wasn't this featured in Legion season 2?  Alternate reality billionaire David; I'm sure he was in this house.
Misterlikeseverythin	And where's the desk/room for my gaming pc?

lee keilok	Well I found free $4362a money making system that is really working:(just go to)  greatworks.club/?KzxPO Great work...
Its Reason	how would... i... it would be difficult to get truly comfortable living there because of the insane value of everything. there are people that would do anything for that house. my anxiety levels would be off the charts. the only thing that would calm me down is having a seal team present 24/7 lol
andrew carter	IS THAT YOU DON DAPRE???????????
Visionhigher	They mentioned a lot of thing regarding this house, but not ones they mentioned how much taxes this house pays a year.
Debb Curry-Millard	Why are there always so many more bathrooms than bedrooms? Dx
halfhawkhalfman	It's a free country where people who've earned what they have can buy what they want. I hope that never changes -  but only a soulless billionaire would buy a $188M home over a $15M home, if doing so prevented them from giving at least a couple $100M to different charitable causes.  Even as an ardent capitalist, disgust is my primary reaction to parts of this video.
B-Weeks	haha..
Cripes Almighty	I would rather live in a log cabin in Idaho.
Shiranova	So you bought this extremely valuable black quartz crystal which was also a family heirloom and removed half of its mass to make a sink out of it? Really?
M F	that is crazy
darlene pham	* cries in *poor* *
BigCooter.com	sterile and ugly .. absolutely NO architectural appeal or styling ... looks more like a converted office building.

crazy gamer	In the desc it says 8th wonder of the work
Ric Ferr	WHY ?.... why this ?
Screw The Net	What a dumbass! That is such a waste of resources, especially money...*smfh * roflolmfao >,;,<
Nexx Level	Well you can really only market this crib to billionaires. Since there’s only like 2500 billionaires out of the 300 million people that means 99.9% of us could NEVER live here. It’s cool and opulent but kind of pointless lol
your welcome	Clean air in California.. Priceless
Black is Back Mahandana	All he could say was crazy and insane
Sean Phillips	All this guy brought up was the cost of everything. Is that really all rich people have to talk about? More money?

Ndala Aviation	"..... INSANE ...CRAZY.. INSANE ... CRAZY  insane... crazy.... insane....crazy ... ins... craz,,,,.
Paul anon	zero class, the furniture and ornaments may have cost millions but in reality they are worthless kitsch junk.
courcheval	The evidence that big and expensive doesnt necessarily mean beautifull. Many tiny houses are more inviting to accomodate yourself than that mansion.
Errique Young	I'll take it
beatz04	"Insane", "nuts", "crazy" - he doesn't mean any of it, he's just bored and more concerned with his appearance and the fitting of his shirt. Besides, they never gonna sell that thing for $188 mill - for that prize it's too small and also convoluted with wannabe "art".
Sid B	5:49 I'm sold, I want this house
Tullock	people selling their mansions for underground ones.
Croaker	Nope
Leo Sagos	Not my taste.  I like classic houses .this is too modern for me

saurabh kumar	Shows the most amazing thing. He only answers - crazy, insane.
aabeeceed	Neat place to visit for a weekend, but definitely not a home; looks like a very expensive hotel. If celebrities live in mansions fully designed by other people, they must feel pretty miserable.
Mace Windu	who would want to buy that
Sumair Ebrahim	Really bad taste man

Samuel Quinn	Someone send me a link to this house is it on Air BnB
Lancelot Xavier	I rather see money go to scientific research for cancer, diabetes, alzheimers then see it be wasted on businessman and celebrities.
TheOne AndOnly	What was it like again?
Neo	This is bullshit you can buy the same house for 10mil without the trash decoration and obsolete items
Josh Frantz	This is not a hate comment or to be bashful but I was a little unimpressed honestly. I grew up in Jackson Hole and had the pleasure and privilege to see amazing homes around the $30 million mark due to our families real estate work, the $30 million homes to me personally, were much more impressive, BUT I don't have $188 million to spend yet so my opinion is but and ants. Lol, first time seeing your videos, and even with my opinions on the house, still a very well put together video that was interesting to watch none the less! Great job, I'll keep my eye out for more videos!
Jonathan Bowen	Wow terrible interior design with overt masstige level branding. What a terrible waste of a great property and location. Utterly tasteless. The pop music in the background !! What the fuck! Horrible ambiance. The salesman has no finesse either. Urrgh. What a load of shite. "the worlds fastest electric motorcycle in the world" haha
MrBdenver	i call the next trend for men : purses  because obviously, phones got to big to be kept in pockets ...
Côme Roullet	Lol so my budget is 888 trillion but I’m not rich
Kareem Kabsha	This hole comment section is negative, be positive for once in your life
stephane sonneville	Money don't buy taste...  $188M ? You can built a bigger, better, mansion for less than $18M. Who wants to give $170M of tacky stuff that come along ?!
Jamus Khan	So you keep all the fire extinguishers in one spot in a house the size of 9 walmarts. Smart!
BaioWithMayo	That house is definitely art and nothing but respect for the designers, but if I had 188 million to burn I'd have my own designers come in and build it exactly how I'd like it. No silver camera in the middle of the floor (like wtf was that) but I'd definitely take that candy and alcohol wall haha. In all seriousness though that house feels like a mall, I want carpets and comfortable couches and a game room and a natural fireplace not a fire wall for looks, just stuff for me to come home to and actually feel like a home...
Sandy S	The house is too cold for my taste, but everything it has inside is pretty cool.
Imtherealthing	Host is so dam gay...hard to watch this
Jack Crypter	crazy
Taha Hadi	Why the fuck is shitty music playing in the background.
yaakcon	How much money do you have to have to buy a house like this? How much does it cost to maintain it?  Do you know what is crazy? People get to live like this when majority of the world's population don't have 2 meals  to eat. They talk about global warming. But I think the humans will eat humans in the near future if this kind of income inequality is not  contained. I am not against capitalism, but please don't tell me these people really made their money like the normal way that you and I are trying to make. When Apple spends less that $100 to make a phone using cheap labor and stolen African resources and then sales 10x profit margin then Mr. Cook can afford this kind of lifestyle. It is sickening to see thousands of hungry people walking thousands of miles to come here just to eat and also thousands dying in mediterranean sea to get to Europe. Very soon the world wars will be a joke.
Mistuh E	Psssh my dog house is much bigger than this tiny shit. .. not impressed at all.

Worel 01	There are people starving in some shitty countries and you buy a stairs worth of 2M dollars .... What´s the point of rich people ?
TcheQ _	insane wow crazy i'm speechless amazing. 5 word vocabulary: Buy my book.
daAnder71	As much as I‘m happy for the people able to afford this, it also awakens my inner socialist. If you are able to pay millions for totally useless suitcases made of marble and just as useless metal balls lining your outdoor pool, then you‘re definitely paying not enough taxes.
Snapper Magoo	This house is overly materialistic. Just bizarre.
GANGBANG	"THAT'S CRAZY"

enZo	Seen this house on Entourage, I think it was the movie not the show, but I'm pretty certain it was Entourage the movie.
Cooperplayz1	Imagine the army of cleaners you'd need to constantly clean all that glass! Fapping to Pornhub in the cinema would be cool though...
Liz Baliira	Anybody else peep peep Beyonce in the tv in the beginning👀
EGarrett01	Fun fact: These houses also come with a healthy supply of rats. There's a serious rat problem in Southern California, particularly in the Hollywood Hills. Look it up.
Halcyonvirtual	Adjectives  and Whistle , that's all he had.
Emily Fox	Honestly with a house like this  i'd sell it and make the worlds largest indoor roller rink for less then half this price. And during the winter months it would be a ice rink.
Delilah Ranae	Time to level up...

Mohamed Essam	went from 250$ M to 188$ M in 1 and a half year, i think it would be worth 50$M in 2025
Joe April	Crazy, insane , crazy wtf?
Maikel K	I doubt a 350 million dollar boat depreciates that much. Boats if well maintained keep their value quite well.
PRO HEN	12 bedrooms, 21 bathrooms. I don't understand these houses with more bathrooms than bedrooms. Do you really have that bad of bladder problems. "I really don't need a bed to sleep on but I've got to be in arms reach of a toilet at all times" WTF.
Bradly TheRadly	Am I the only one that wouldn't want to live here?
Jessi Hogarth	Any one know the intro song ? Best part of the vid
That Guy	I’ll buy it for 11.25 final offer
Lojjik Braughler	This doesn't actually appeal to me. Perhaps because the price is due to rare materials and artistic design than functionality and technology.
SPADES WINNER	Who is cleaning the house?
Marie Shines	With so many poor people, so many battling middle class people, this is a DISGUSTING and SICKENING example of  extravagant wealth. Big house is still EMPTY !!

JAME MANGA	Wish could live 4 eva
Malligrub 1	Whenever I see a house like this filled with all that stupid crap, I think about what hopelessly flawed, foolish, unwise and deeply damaged human must own it.
De LaMar	Well, if I'm not mistaken I saw videos from this house already a year ago and the price tag was well over $200 million. Things seem not to go that well right? Seems we have finally reached the climax of house pricing insanity.
Jeremi Taribo	Just make this House a Museum!
gsolee	Honestly, there were so many things he could have said! Other than crazy

Nicholas G.	Neither comfortable, nor tasteful, not even architecturally interesting. There is more logic and honesty in a 50K Tiny House parked in a forest than in this loud-mouthed bling of a monstrosity.  And no, sorry, I'm as capitalist as they come. I just choose to appreciate more meaningful things in my life.
KDad514	Ryan "That's Insane" Serhant
Pass The Pickle	The house was in the bench warmers
Tony k	i'm a Billionaire and this, is a waste of my money. thank you.
Bass Trammel	Good luck too anyone who spends $188 million on someone else's personalized house and lives in it. That takes a lot of guts, even if it's loaded with the latest kind of luxury.
Alexandre Dumas-Richer	THAT'S INSANE
ATA KUPON	Huuum, i have seen this house from inside before. But i was more concentrated on Lisa Ann at that particular time.  With that being said, I have one question: Why?
Andrew Buchanan	This is why we cant even feed everyone...
Doug Beechey	you know you are way too rich when your staircase is more expensive than mansions.
Lonely Underground	The thumbnail looks like a GTA V screenshot
djBOB 365	please mic your guests next time.
burrito rustler	this house is loaded up with a lot of crap that would be going straight to Goodwill if I were buying it - all of that designer trash is really tacky, anyone with any class wouldn't want any of it! - so once you cut out all of the crap, it's probably worth more like 20 million on a good day! - hell, maybe not even that much, where is the ocean view? - ooops, there is none! - lol
Michael Young	Looks like no one has even guessed how many times that you said crazy, Ryan. But here I don't even make barely over 15 dollars an hour and no way do I make enough of a living to even try to guess anything near that house or what you have in your oh petty change pocket; and I would probably have to go to college for years on end, just to be what a janitor in that house or to manage your accountant. Maybe I I'll become an geologist, metallurgist, mechanic, rolled into one. The upkeep on something like that house has got to be the real insane/crazy part. I'd much rather be my poor ass self. Here let me give away my book to you, go to 911truthministries.blogspot.com; me I am just a poor guy.  My counting skills are not good, but I counted unofficially without my much paying attention, and I could be wrong. But I counted 1Complete Crazy 1 Craziest Thing 9 Crazy's 8 Insane  1 Nuts 1 awesome 1Bonkers. Here is my email address nine11eleventruthministries@yahoo.com, hey I would not mind a free signed book and a video message from you. Hey! Man my life is way less exciting than what you have going on.    My girlfriend is in an Italian American chick who sings in a band and tours a lot. I have plenty of time to read and watch your video Ryan.   So pay up. LOL.  Whether I won or not. Oh! And by the way I used to watch your show on TV, you were my favorite.
ReggieBernard	1:09 Factually incorrect, real estate on average does not outpace performance of the market (S&P500). Hence why the wealthy invest in stocks and bonds, but middle class invest their money in their homes and pay interest on the mortgage.
VenTus	"40 of your closest friends." Who the hell has 40 'close' friends? Oh wait this is Los Angeles. Anyone who follows you on instagram is a close friend there.
Fast AF	Some Arminian decorated this house, all that money an still looks fugly

Talinthis	bust down that onyx wall at 5:40 so i can sell it and pay off my house. would save me like 10 years of payments.
JOUDIAH	but why
Mark Darlington	Bored, bored, watching this.
Devon Opden Dries	So the price of the house is mostly just the stuff in it?  If I bought it, there'd be some crazy stuff popping up on Ebay almost immediately.  Also for having so many speakers and entertainment systems in such an elegant home, it's unfortunate that they chose such awful music to play in the background.
David Austin	So bruce makowsky gets this brilliant idea.  Buy this property for $15M, put a $5M house on it with $5M of upgrades (like a $1M staircase), $15M of cars and a $1M helicopter, and list it for $250M even though he had only $42M into it.  Tells everyone than everything inside is worth 2x what it really costs and that everything is included to justify the price (I mean who's going to check his math?).  After it drops to $180M, some moron with more money then smarts comes along and gives him a "low-ball" offer of $140M, which bruce will take.  net profit: $100M.  Smart.  Meanwhile all you are geeking out as if it's worth as much as he says it is.
eggo	Insane.         Sure.

Ahmet Küçük	Some people are so poor, all they have is money
Levi Ackerman	I'll never understand why rich people by giant mansions with over a dozen bedrooms and baths. I mean the fuck? I can only sleep in one bed and I can only take a shit on one toilet at a time... And also I don't want a house so big that I have to take the subway to get from the living room to the nearest bath...

Emanuel	Yes no problem I take it! Gates... Pay the Bill!
Hiho Wego	Honey  onyx prices just doubled after this vid.
Kai	think most of us didn’t notice this insanely luxurious mansion only worth half of the list price for a Boeing 777-300er, which we often pay less than 100 bucks to take.
Nopez20	So rich people have 0 taste is what i'm getting from this, i could make a much nicer house for 1/50th of that price and have it be a home, not a building which looks like something out of a porno. Just goes to show that Americans have 0 taste.
Mehmet Gultekin	outro song anyone?
AxelNotHuman	haha fucking Yuppies, all useless for any family
LD_805_Life Daniels	Worthless house !
Bikepacking	WHOS  BRUCE ???]

chris turner	why do you need more bathrooms than bedrooms???
Trey Salsbury	He doesn't really have a buyer for that property. He just wanted to go to CA and check out the house and stroke that other agent.
David Hamilton	So cool. All that and zero tackyness. Also no poor people allowed. They could steal anything from that house and become rich.
Abert Albert	The size of a man's house is inversely proportional to his EGO
Amna Tanveer	Im not a house designer but this house feels like a box that has expensive things placed inside like a museum.
Sebastian Keano	The biggest blunder of this house is HELICOPTER that CAN NOT FLY since it's prohibited in residential areas.
western Sahraoui	Crazy
Bill MASE	3:41 touch
Marctoonz	The richest Bootleg movie ever 9:13

Baskets	Views man the views are nice there
Sbeth85	Who is this Bruce guy? I want a series about him.
Timo Smuts	Song at 9:50?
Azmo141	188 Million Mansion and not a single sauna? As a Finn i'm disappointed.
Omar A	Who cares about the price. Please mention the expenses that come with it... Electricity, security, cleaning, etc. I mean why would any sane person buy this even if hes got billions. Id want a place were i could rest not a place that'll cause my heart attack.
MOSES HOOPER	I promised MR GREG FRANKLIN that I will testify when I get my profit, I was broke and stranded, not knowing what to do, but after some words with him he assured me that all would be fine. I invested with him and to my greatest surprise I go my profit just a week after I traded. Wow! I'm so proud, I can finally clear my bills without thinking twice. God bless you very much MR GREG FRANKLIN , I believe you will continue doing good works for those in need here, you are an account manager among other managers For those of you who wants to invest and don't know what to do because you've lost money or have been a victim of scam in the past, I advice you to get in touch with him.  I HAVE ACCESS TO MY TRADING ACCOUNT I MAKE WITHDRAW MYSELF NO EXTRA CHARGES OR FEE   CONTACT HIM VIA EMAIL: gregfranklin18@gmail.com
Mujahid Manzoor	Wtf?  Smh such a waste of money. Anyone who buys it is a fucking moron.
Hans-Peter Luttke	Buying a house in Bel-Air costs between 1.5 and 30 Million $ The 30 Million house has 135,000 Sq Ft and 2.07 Acres in whole. This house in the video must have cost around 10-20 Million to build, that shitty staircase is a joke by the way. Than put trashy stuff in it with mostly fake luxury labels, which must be annoying as fuck to remove that shit. The cars and motorcycle stuff is nice, but you can buy an Bugatti Veyron at around 1 Million $ easly. Dump the price to 40 Million and you could sell this piece of shit if you also get rid of that sensless camera. I own some real estate my own and I know what things cost, the building costs don't automaticly double  just because the building site is expensive.
Mr Holistic	shame on you....homeless starving people and you spend 188m on a house. scumbag
csabo1725	On February 4 2017 another video showed the price at $250000000. Guess it wasn’t such a good investment after all.
DJ Nuro	No one is going to buy it, they'll have to keep lowering the price
Ken Powers	"Crazy...nice...crazy..." RS.
DJ Tress	this house is stupid..
animal0mother	6:33 "... and Bruce would say, 'Everything's for sale,' ..." Lol don't introduce Bruce to your daughter...       ...or totally do.

Discern It	‘Sure” 🙄
Josh	This is Dan Bilzerian new pad! 👌 Epic!
Strange videos dont ask dont question	It's gets harder not to want rob these people. Maybe it's just human nature. When u see someone who was way more than they know what to do with an u have nothing living life struggling emotionally and financially. It can be hard I work a 9 to 5 I'm sure we all do but how come there hasn't been violence that as ensued with jelousy  or hate being carried towards these rich far cats?
Idalia Torres	everything is ugly sorry but i seen more beautiful places this is going over board so someone wanting to but the house has to buy it with all that other junk they might not like plz...
rea goldson	they couldn't give the tour guide a mic?
John F	This guy is a complete parody of himself, constantly stating how "expensive" everything is. Really shows you how arbitrary material and possesions can be. Money doesn't buy happiness folks.
GabsieGaming	If i have $188 million, i would buy T-series and deleted it.
Adzy82	The house I love it’s beautiful no kidding... but I find its content looks tacky but each to their own. I seen so much fake LV and Chanel products it just looks like someone’s trying to big note off a fashion label. Awesome house I’d just deck it out different 🤣
B Xx	The exterior of the house is ugly. Too modern and doesn't give the house any feel
Justin White	Nobody will ever buy this. Period
SHAUN VAN PRUDE	Don't say it.. let me guess .. crazy right?

harith zharfan	Neymar valued more than this house
Mat c	Insane.
Jerry Chavis	If I had a 188 million, I'd get the best gaming setup possible for pc and console. And that would only cost like $10,000
Muscle Tribe of Excellence	Meanwhile we have over 40,000 homeless veterans. But don't worry. Just work hard and someday you will be able to buy a mansion too. The fact that close to 50% of all jobs pay under 30,000 dollars a year won't matter. Because you will work so hard. I'm sick of the worship shit like this gets. Wake the fuck up people. This house and houses like it are dedicated for a select club and you are not fucking in it.
untouchable360x	I would just buy a $1 million dollar shack next door and blow the $187 million on hookers and blow.
Cameron Hollis	Hahaha. Ryan was so bored listening to this guy rambling on and on. If the house was emptied of the over the top art and flashy crap and priced accordingly it would sell.
Francisco Salcido	I remember seeing this house on Zillow. I thought it was brilliant to have the helicopter. It obviously says you can't fly it regularly but I knew the moment I saw it that they have it because if there was ever a huge earthquake in LA (which there will be) they have a form of leaving. I always thought about buying a helicopter if I ever won the lottery lol I'm glad someone else thought of it and actually did it
Anthony Sefo	Home? More like a shopping mall
Mack Daddy	meh.
XGiveMeLibertyX	I'm not impressed. The house is cool sure but this guy just keeps drooling over all the material crap in this place
cool bian	does the owner like beyonce?
Richard Beck	Wasn’t this house over $200M’s about a year ago 🤔🤔🤔
Jarrod Reed	Waste of money. Would rather have a much more technological house in a different state with about 5-10k acreage. No solar system for energy, geothermal for heat.
Altitude1	Forget the 21 bathrooms. Just give me a regular 2k square inch house with a 21 car garage for my hobby.
Wasiu Adeyeye	People who actually could even afford to buy this home will only be home for about 1-2 months in a year combined it will cost you so much to maintain even after you buy it, it makes no sense lol I’d get a couple min dollars homes in NY, LA and Miami and call it a day. Money does not buy happiness
Eylmao	*Sure* *Crazy* *Insane* *Woah* The perfect vocabulary
Dillon Beesley	I'd buy it just to look through that smog every day!
Chloe Lewis	wow
BroMandudeKnar	I probably couldn't even afford the ice cubes there.

Austerity Cat	You should had given the other guy a microphone, he's saying very interesting things with bad audio while the good one is just there for ''craaaazy''
AVLRECORDS	it was worth 500 so it didnt sell
BeingOfLight 1111	For that price, I would rather custom build mine with Carbon Fiber siding dragon plate, titanium frame and aerogel vaccum insulation.
iShootUDrive1	This is one of the most pretentious things I've ever seen before. Also, how fucking lonely would you get in the house like that? As my dad used to always say, if you have a million-dollar boat but no real friends to sail on it with you, you're sunk.
Tommy Grønvold	I just bought it, moving in tomorrow!!       Naaaaah... Fake news!
Aitor Rodriguez	why no 4k resolution?

Peter Ion	Yeah , I was thinking of a smart-ass comment about plumbing or something , and then thought , ‘nah , not worth it’.  Rather like the house itself . Not ‘ crazy’ , just self-indulgent , self-congratulatory meh !
Mau García	Who the fuck is Bruce
Paulo Moniz	I dont understand the price.  Location sucks, architeture sucks, has some boring tech on it (like cinema on 2018 what a joke).

SILV3R _R3APER	Houses like this are not worth it because of water electric bills that’s why there are so many abandoned manchines in new york
smcaskey	if I recall correctly the helicopter doesn’t have an engine, it’s just for more stuntin
Dennis Af Forselles	"watch the nfl with 40 of your closest friends".... ofc u have atleast 40 closest friends with that kind of money
comedycopter	Yeah your neighbors going to love you taking off in that helicopter I don't even think that's legal. How could you spend a hundred eighty eight million dollars and go so wrong
Rom 3636	Shit like this is for the 1% that own half the worlds wealth, people so rich it’s actually VULGAR, they spend money on absolutely pointless SHIT, they have enough money to REALLY make a difference and set some things right in this world but instead they’re spending money on handbags made of onyx???

Miska Gano	Think about something ye, he spent $2milion on STARIS, A normal person would be able to live with that money without a job for the rest of his life. How fucked up is that...
T1tusCr0w	So the rest of us get the permanent shit end of the stick so a couple of fuckers can have this and treat the world like their whorehouse and the temperature of this rock keeps rising too as they need forever growth. And they can't even buy taste it seems.
Colin Birnie	Gross

Modareal 678	I just felt poor after watching this video

Crytpo ganza 1658948	Crazy how people are homeless and starving in a lot of parts of the world
Airdrifting	Obviously he forgot to mention all the roads that lead up to the house, Or any house in Bel Air in general, Are those tiny streets that can barely allow two cars to pass, full of potholes, uneven pavements and sharp turns going uphill. If it wasn't for all the tall walls on each side, You'd think you are in some sort of ghetto.
CubeRepublic	WOW INSANE A WORD SANDBLASTED ONTO A ROCK

Mark Li	crazy！
John C	Crazy
Doc Ragnarok	I'll never understand the obsession with overpriced shiny shit... IDC if I had $1703149539135876291363597874... I just want a ranch out in the midwest with some livestock, peace and quiet, my wife, kids and my dogs.... instead I live on the coast with a bunch of assholes.
DS LigHT & DaRkNeS	Well I found free $5143a money making system that is really working:(just go to)  greatworks.club/?VTOgY Great work...
Alex Shaw	crazy
warbob	Total waste of money, and Ryan knows it. He only commented that's insane, not about the product, but after learning how much that product cost. Some people have got so much money that they don't know what to do with it, and Ryan's job is to get that money away from them and into his business.
Joshua Esters	I wouldn't even know what to say getting a tour of that house.
Txx Lxx	It is not a home now, is it?  By the way, you should really fix the audio issues.

buckithed	But how do you justify spending that much on crap you don't need. Like that pile of yellow rocks isn't serving you any purpose. I wonder how many people one has to cheat to afford a house like this.
M. G.	for $188 million, u can help a lot of poor people in the world !!! this would be more important!!!
jmpmcd	more like a Saudi hotel . filthy rich is such an accurate description .  dirty with wealth and no real concept of the word poor .
1jeffr	Apparently someone has to much money on their hands
LIVING ROOM	Where is the Master Bed & Bath? Am I right!?
len frijoles	C R A Z Y
D P	well for that price this house is UGLY. Louis Vuitton is known to be quite tacky and its not an every day look so building a house and having everything lv orange and brown is terrible. has some great pieces, loved the camera sculpture, but the gloss all over the house is too much. the floors, walls, i bet the ceilings are all glossy. just no.
Jonathan Rojas	If I had a penny for every time he said "crazy" ill have 188 million dollars.
Seth Marchese	If I owned that house I would probably feel so empty inside you would find me passed out on top of the helicopter from shooting heroin.
Raul Flores	Expensive ass home and you got Beyonce playing in the background?!?! They should have Mozart or something like that
MagikkEmpire	https://anchor.fm/rama-montana/episodes/SMM--Halloween-Special-Episode-1-e2g1so

Alex Johnson	Yo imagine spilling cherry kool-aid in the house
yash chaudary	could I have the anchor for free?
Ugo Oko	vanity upon vanity
Liz I love you	This video has inspired me to become an interior designer as whoever designed this house obviously got paid so imagine how much I’ll make and I can actually do it right!! And sell the place!! (Hint: nobody buys Louis Vitton anymore and Art is personal so don’t buy such specific pieces that only a tiny fraction of the population would appreciate)
Booty Duty	Does it come with 40 friends?
yacine bennaceur	I would remove that art. It does not look livable with that creepy weird shit.
zaramagi kayihura	I feel like he wasn't listening to the guide person
Moviathan	property tax is probably why anyone would not want to buy this house.
CDubb2k8	2 million dollar staircase....too extra man!
Donald McHattie	Beyond the wildest dreams of avarice.  It's called 'vulgar display of wealth' and it is a sign of moral decay.  Meanwhile, a billion+ people live hand to mouth.  Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.
David Aaron	Who is this “Bruce” guy he keeps mentioning?
Oller Manden	This is insane        And crazy
Indospace-dot io	Who the hell has 40 close friends????!

Jimmy B	Late stage capitalism
B bo	My best friend lives in a very large loft the same size.  It takes a few minutes to get to the front door when a visitor arrives.  She’s also rich and famous. Let me tell you, she’s the most miserable and lonely person I’ve ever known. Buying this house won’t make you any happier.  If you don’t have legitimately good friends a house like this will not serve as a substitute friend either.  People look at her on the street and want to be her.  They think she has everything they want.  Fame and fortune are only appealing to those who don’t have them. Get a job you want to do, make decent friends that are not impressed with your money or notoriety, buy things you can afford and you will most likely be better off than the person who can afford this house.  The person who buys this house will be someone who is desperate to show others how successful they are.  As an investment this house is a gamble. No comps to compare it too. Most likely a Saudi buyer who can buy this place without ever needing to stay in it.
Mohammad Hossain	Doesn't seem cozy
Anton Alano	He keeps on saying "crazy" "insane" which annoys me.
big fan of yours	The bugatti very on is not 4 million pounds  it is around 2.5 million pounds unless the person is in America than the price is double

Jonathan Black	God this is so lame.
Sam M	The house is ugly and seems soulless
jjsinner	It's fancy and all but it looks like more of a shopping mall than a home. No atmosphere, personality or homely welcome. Just looks cold and empty tbh. Typical form over function mentality.
Dizik	Look how amazing the rich life is in California while the state has the most poor people in the US. Democratic government btw.

PNG	So you can buy the house without all that shit inside for maybe 90mil?
Kevin Fooken	There's so much stuff I just never would want our need...
C VDP	So depressing to watch. It's like a partyroom that was made for a party that is never going to happen. Just try to imagine living in a house like that. I'd kill myself after a week.

TheTruth	Gei
S F	lol the taxes will rape your asshole for another 50 million before you can even consider selling it in cali. in 10 years... and that's not to mention the ridiculous crime rate essentially another 3 mill just for security to live on the property over a 10 year period if you are lucky. incomes are high in cali so you best believe 6 figures is a good deal for an armed guard. and then after all of that IF you are lucky you'll find some schmuck to pay more than what you paid for it assuming the economy doesn't crash as the country goes to shit ESP cali with their retarded laws
LorkyMX2	I'm 3 minutes in and all hes said is "insane" and "crazy", seriously your representing clients who are purchasing hundreds of millions of dollars at a time and all you can say are 1-2 words.

Fuschi	Looks like a house, not a home
Iamgazz	I must be more substance over style (if you can even call it that) because the only thing that I liked about this property was the swim around jacuzzi.
Cube 0	ME TOO.. I am going back to my normal life.. SAD !

steve thomas	ha on the market for 188 million ----- 70 milllion less than they originally asked !
Charlie Payne	No house should cost that much. It’s all bollocks.
sAintJoy	it looks somthing like what dan bilzerian woud buy
Billy Boland	We all know what parrots do, "pieces of eight, pieces of eight" only this one doesn't have feathers, but does have the mentality of the said bird, the owner on the other hand has no idea of taste or elegance.
Songo	Get better camera stabilization, shakes all over the place, especially upon staircase review. Also right at 5:40 we begin to notice loss of sound, more mics and post editing needed.
Noah Sno	I'd buy it for the bugatti.
Popenator 7	Look's like *Dan Bilzerian* house but way more ugly! I wouldn't be hard choise for me, i like that bastard's taste! (and the bud's(even never tasted those))

Matej Ivanković	WHO OWNS THIS?
Han Skinslo	I love a beautiful home as much as anyone else.  I totally get having a big, nice home if you have the money, but this is a waste of money, in my opinion.  You only need SO MUCH.  Imagine how many people someone could help with all the money the extreme features cost?
TheAyrony	that ugly ass steel camera drags the prize down a few mill

Farrukh Husnain	Crazy people.
A Gill	188 Million for a house is bit too much, I live in a small house but it is a home where I get sleep and eat food cooked by myself. Even If I ever earn or get that money, I would never go for it. Waste of money and valuation of 188 millions is not true at all. Ryan can you go back into porn :)
FpsRix	Who ever buys that can send me few millions, thanks!
Follow The Grow	This isnt so much a house but a very nice club. Barf

Sensei Seagal	Jesus Christ!! How many times did Ryan say, "Insane" or "that's crazy"?? What ever happened to saying, things like,  "absolutely spectacular/amazing/stunning, gorgeous, beautiful, priceless? Maybe it's because I am high right now and I heard him say insane and crazy like 40 times.

Rafael Rodriguez	And to think assuming the Realtor makes 3% commission he would make $5,640,000 from this closing alone....
Sandy Mares	This doesn't feel like a home it feels like a museum. Some of the stuff in it is just ridiculous. Like why why would you need a huge camera in your home??
Todd Peucker	40 of your "closest" friends....ha. doubt I've had half that in the whole of my life. And what's up with billionaires having no sense of style? Every piece of furniture and art was just an homage to some designer brand of everyday elitist consumerism....geez. overtly gaudy can be amusing to look at for a few minutes but ugly to live around long-term. That house doesn't feel homey and warm with unique personality of the individual who will live there. It seems like a cold museum.
Film ReaLity	With $188m, my house should be flying with techs and even communicating with me, this house is great but not too expensive arts or cars or Heli., I will buy them myself, so take all out, and give me the naked price of the house.
sleepy962007	I would be interested to hear more about the AV equipment shown around 10:03. I slowed it down to .25 and from what I can see looks like planar video matrixs for the video walls, a bunch of directv boxes, sonos players, crestron control and video matrixs for the house stuff, crestron lighting panels, kaleidescape video vault, and a LOT of amplifiers (2 full racks worth it looks like)!

Oliver Marawueke	This isn't a house for a civilian even a billionaire. This is a drug cartel king pin's hideout. Pablo Escobar type of compound.

Amensi Party	This house is not attractive what so ever, i seen a million dollar house that is still to this day my dream house, because it got taste. The house just feels like, brag brag brag brag brag, and i do this for my friends look at all those chairs, who want to invite fake friends into your house no way that somebody can maintain 40 really good friends. It is just too much.
GAMINGwithRAI Laur	damn.. i wish i had such mansion...
Doug Maverick	Statistics show that most people who are filthy rich are some of the most unhappy people on the planet, as they worship the dollar instead of the Lord. I'll take a tiny house over this any day of the week.

Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?  27 For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels,  and then He will repay each one according to what he has done.… https://youtu.be/iD4ILyzqxM0
Jaleel	All that money but a hoe will still cheat on you.
Parimal ,	The interiors to some extent are really unique but this doesn't have a proper home feel to it. Feels more like office cum hotel. Who needs so many decks near the swimming pool in a home ? And too much glass around, hope it's atleast bullet-proof.
Michaelthevagabondpoet	...and the insanity of humanity continues...and shall destroy our posterity unless...
vanPoll	Well, on the list of crazy mansions... this is really far up. When I saw the camera sitting in the hall, I thought it was awesome. Then they walked down into the garage, where he has a Veyron as "just a car" out of a selection of exquisite rides.

Jamie Hager	Meanwhile in the real world; some people don't have access to clean water.
Karol Kozak	Looks like no one has ever live there... it looks sterile and glossy, i get it, 190 mil at which point you're buying a lifestyle not a house. And you probably have other real estate worth that much :) I wonder if anyone's ever gonna buy it cause all of those custom features are something the original owner would do, not the new one. At that point someone who's got 190 mil to spend is most probably going to buy his/her own custom designed home just because they can.
Lunamaria	I'll take 7
Jett Blacc	Looks like a fucking indoor mall with all the sounds and effects wtf.

Ritesh Dube	What makes me wonder is how can this house cost so less like you guys can watch mukesh ambani's house antilia building cost was around 1-2 billions

Ancha Batubara	this house have an Airwolf
Abasi Akan	You know, this house may actually be worth more than $188 million, if you add up some of the art pieces and cars alone...like a TWO million dollar staircase and 4 million dollar Bugatti...this could be a 'steal' at 188 mil

momentinpassing	I like this shopping mall but I buy most things from Amazon now. Good day.
johnj	Most of that stuff is not really worth anything and would not make your life any better. But there are a lot of rich and vain people to whom you can sell stuff you say is "insane".
flauschflausch	The owner should fly in all the poor people from the caravan from Mexico to live there!!!  With a big FUCKYOU sign (like HOLLYWOOD) to Trump and Fox. Peace
3Vimages	It is truly horrible ......  Classless.
Jova R.	This is an epic house, but this is way too big to be a home. If you can't walk around your house butt naked without worrying about someone seeing, is it really a home?
Elann Suvat	And it's a cold house. I'd rather live in a cozy little home, any day of the week.

Muller Thomas	I live in an apartment alone and I feel so bored and lonely, if I lived in this house I will kill myself.
f0rumrr	And what is the upkeep, to keep a house like that functioning. I would say around 5 million a year.
The Code Provider	not worth the money tbh
Hasib RK	What just happened?
U MadBro yo	My favorite part is when he says *that's insane*
Charles Dibben	Honestly makes me sick to my stomach when I'm sitting in a pile of student loan debt & am struggling to make my car payment. On top of that the aesthetic is sooo tacky & lacking creativity. Carving designer luggage out of "Honey Onyx" doesn't mean your art is original or inspiring. It means you spent a lot of money and want everyone to know that to feed your ego & God complex. For shame.
Alex Morozov	I will give you $1 for it.
Mike The Tiger	Dan Bilzerian bought this house right?
luke oneil	That’s it
Billy Big Bollocks	How Jewish is the tour guy? Everytime he talks about money he is watering at the mouth.

iTz Newblood	Rich guys only 1080p -.-
DeathWish808	I wouldn't actually want to live in this place.  Oh, I certainly like a lot of things and layout but NAH... I would want to change so many things.  I would never spend money on certain stone or a fucking staircase that costs more than most people's houses.  To each their own. It's definitely cool as shit but not my style.  This is a gold digger magnet. lmao.
Zap Tv	How are those Tax breaks trickling down to you.
David Korr	Whoever that dude is with Ryan is not telling the truth. The late Paul Allen's yacht, Octopus, was not $400M. It was $200M. And if anyone with a yacht like that decided to charter it, they would make, at least, $1M per week. Over time, one could recoup their initial investment.
DEAD CARP	188 Million and playing that shuck and jive crap music
Ryan Curran	This house has been for sale since it was built. Way too expensive.

Mystic Synn	Can come back anytime?  How about tomorrow, and the day after that, etc until someone buys it.  =)
dominic chan	so is the house expensive or the cars and paintings in it?
Active Patato	I would go through intense anal to afford this house
T12J7	You guys want to know how to make 212 million dollars and live in that house? Here's how - you get a bank loan of 188 million and with that, you buy that house. When you have bought the house, you sell that Jadestone (at part 05:37) with 400 million dollars. After that, you pay back the loan of 188 million and you pocket that 212 million dollars. Now you own that house and have 212 million in your pocket. You can thank me later - waiting for the invitation to your housewarming party. : )  You can also sell the house after the housewarming party, and walk away with 400 million in your pocket. In that case, don't forget to take me with you when you go clubbing the first time with your 400 million. ; )
Jin Spada	why does every tv have beyonce
Galactus	Its to bad its within that disgusting L.A. air quality.  No good view.
worldadventureman	Youtubes ad at the beginning of this video is of a girl starving in India and it says you can feed her for $6.80 per month. If these scum just sold their $300,000 powder room they could feed her for 3,600 years!

KTMs 1	If the economy is a pie, just imagine how much smaller your piece got from the person who ends up owning this.
Valery Lavrov	Ok place. next level of neurology  / biotechnology (evolution) would render this place obsolete. Still cave man still care for things that not worth attention.
darren nelson	that house surely did drop its price its been on the market along time lol it was 250m or something hahahah 1-3 years ago lol
Polarbear	I love seeing all the comments crying about how (its such a waste of money) (i cannot even afford a 'insert word here') (he must have ripped someone off to get this rich). Most people do not do anything at all to find a way to earn more money and spend half their time glued to their stupid smart phone talking about bullshit with their 1000 online friends. Most people are locked into a system and the expectation to get a safe job, pay all the bills and spend the rest of their pay check with nothing left to show for it afterward. Build your wealth, and stop buying stupid things you simply do not need. You will not be as rich as the billionaire that owns this mansion, but you will be in a far better position than you are in right now.
TheUnknownRoach	best i can do is $25
Enrique Navarrete	So i can put a 1 million diamond in my house and say it cost 1.2 million ? -_-
MyBallsUrJaws	LOL the realtor saying the property value would only climb unlike a mega yacht... The sign in the house (2:54) says "$250,000,000 Mega Estate" and the value is $188,000,000... Math's a lil off there bud 🤔 apparently 1+1=$$62million...

Alex de Figueiredo Neumahn	This was the 250 million dollar mansion that wasn't sold Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Idiots!
Doomreb	These are the kinda houses that take a little longer than others to buy. Even for rich people because the price is tied up in the special 'pieces' and not in the actual mansion. If you buy this you need to specifically like all of those little individual pieces that are the real reasons for making the price tag so 'insane' 'crazy' and 'nuts'. You can get really huge places with more bedrooms and nicer overall but here you're paying for stone carvings, a rock sink, artistic staircase, etc. And BTW are they sponsored by Beyonce? Knock it off.
Truls Brubakken	What just happened? That was insane. Crazy. Woow.

Joseph Visser	I'm just here trying to pay off my student loans and this guy has a set of honey onyx louis vuitton suitcases sitting in the corner of his house by his 2 million dollar staircase. Fuck
jlushefski	How do you sell a completed home for that price?  I would imagine that anyone spending 200mil on a house would want to have it built according to their personal tastes and styles, no?  I mean unless it's simply an "extra" for a super wealthy foreigner, it seems strange to build something so expensive without a specific buyer already in mind.
moo cow	Always enjoy watching Ryan either on TV or on You Tube.
Onkel Iro	Id be rich i would buy this house just to destroy this ugly ass camera

ModernNomad	WTF, all that money and still not that great style. I mean it's not bad, but pretty boring. At least the old many could build a skate park. What is with the bro thing at the end? Haha! ;)
Yorzen Gaming	When you hacked GTA V so much that you don't know where to spend your money on... only in real life O_O

iman леопард	can i have this house
KING OF HEARTS	21 bathrooms,12 bedrooms and half house is haunted after 3 weeks, your staff wants to kill you for money and your security is corrupt, your wife sleeps with other man when you're in helicopter, and your kids don't know the worth of money cause they never seen crisis, doesn't care when you have cappuccino machine near closet.
Adara Gia	Who is this Bruce you speak of?
Mustafa Yılmaz	What a regular life 😁
Pug Darclay	about the same price-tag as my 2bedroom apartment here in Sydney
4321Enjoy	The Interior designer hired for this house has 0 fucking taste wtf
Chris Douglas	What really gets me is 99% of the gorgeous cars dont get driven
Ezra Po	Look at my 250 million dollar Bugatti!!! Oh you could buy one that is functional and awesome to the max for 1.5 million but does it have original Picasso's as interior?  Does it have the head of Leonardo da Vinci's "David" as the hood ornament?  Or how about this Shroud of Turin floor mat?  This is a load of bullshit!  I have seen 2 million dollar mansions that I would by far rather live in than this over hyped bull crap. Get the hell outta here 188 million.
The Dob	but can it run crisis?
Mc Lovin	Does ANYONE know what the song at 10:00 is PLEASE!??
redrobotmonkey	The LV sculptures are so ugly and trashy looking. The giant anchor and camera? For so much money, they have such bad taste. It's like the hillbillies of Beverly hills owned this house.
Sosa Ruhinda	what are the neighb0urs 1ike th0?
Willi Hansen	To be that rich must be troubling. When money isn't your main problem, you're forced to confront all the other things that are wrong in your life.
Marisa Licastro	Seriously..the owner probably lives in that house twice a year..n the meantime a thousands of third world country families..have not even a tent to sleep in for half a second..ridiculous amount of money wasted on materialistic snobbery..
Robert Christopher Smith	Design is not so impressive.

RavFrom Yetti	it doesn't have a magnetic room to have fun in, WACK.

Lyon Willman	Like yeah I wouldnt turn it down but fuck its tacky!!
Keith Brauders	Dan Blizerians house  no?
MARTYR	Best commentator lol. Sure. Thats crazy. And thats insane.. but honestly what more can you say.

NEFFY JR	HI random person scrolling down the comments
jordanz	I like it.
acoe Corey R	Who owned this home?
Alfredo Diaz	Wow! Speechless
ARXDMOS	too bad considering the communist California you cannot have most guns that the rest of the free world have access to

Kawaii Batman	That's what you got? "Wow", "Crazy", "Insane", "*whistle*"?? even an introvert could become the host for this video WOW
Coonalisa	I love Beyoncé playing in the background
youtubasoarus	Probably the neatest thing in there, aside from the cars, is that big ass camera. I always imagine if people get stupid rich they can do more stuff like that. Collect odd things. Most of that place is pretty sedate. When you've got the sort of cashola to buy a place like that i'd imagine you could buy crazier things, like a 20 foot tall pink teddy bear or some shit. Or one of those Jaws animatronic models from Universal Studios pops out of your floor and scares the shit out of people when they enter. Stuff like that. Helicopter is a waste btw.
RmRm SafaRii	Does anyone think Ryan uncannily resembles Josh Duhamel in this video?
̈Fillip Langhoff	I said wow a million times watching this video, and i was watching it alone.
Jordi Barendsen	"'Watching the Super Bowl with 40 of you're closest friends''. If you have that money you have no friends. Period.
Fayyaad Magnuficentia	This guy is an idiot talking about value and shit. Just live. Money is no longer an issue at these levels. People are fucked.
JMan007	Poor maid
Caleb Lindley	This house is OK, but you can get better houses then this in North Yorkshire, and which are homely. The is house is not a home, just an over rated hi tech museum.
Pierce Chiasson	Franklin's house was nicer.
Matt Atkinson the second	Iv seen a tour of this house on multiple shows.... clearly overpriced.... they cant sell it
Corey King	just to point this out, the $30 Million Mansion that Mark Cuban bought was one of the most expensive homes in the entire state of Texas. Dont forget everything may be bigger in Texas but its sure as hell more expensive in Cali. I want to know how much does it cost a month in Maintenance on this house, if its fully staffed and a helicopter I can bet its costly and compares a lot to a boat.
krisko bingo	what about being house less ... to what i understand the whole country is there estate ... millions of houses and kitchens and staff and bathrooms ... the only thing is that they just cant decide what to do with all that so they just stay outside ...
Kevin Gatton	one piece of wall art costs more  than I've ever made in my life lol
Garland5	Jesus!! Who built this place?A billionaire no doubt. This level of wealth makes me feel ill. The cars indoors, the theatre, the Birkin bag carved out of onyx.....it's just excessive. Think of all the people who could be helped with even a fraction of this money.
Luigi504Tv	How much is it to clean the house though?
PistonFly Service	I love Luxury Listings

liljunior805	Is this the house Jay Z and Beyonce bought?
Johnny He	my saving account won't last 1 min...no, maybe 30 seconds
Javier Maldonado	Unnecessary things everywhere, if you remove stupid things like the bathroom with diamonds or what ever it is, you have more money to spend on Fortnite skins haha. Well I guess that if you are thinking to buy a 188M house is because you can afford that and more. fuck my life
Kevin Yiaile	So they lowered the price from 250 million dollars and it's still expensive 😭
marco solis	imagine hide n seek in this house
Alex Pavlenko	250 million? / Yea, / Private Stewardship? / Of Course Mi'sou / helicopter comes with it I presume / most deffi.. We'll take it. Q the intro music
O.G. cummins w250	take 2 plz

The Seattle Cyclist	Gluttony and greed at its finest... gross.
James	i would throw out all the shitty art if i bought the house.
Lt. Ling	187 Million more for me to go>
MarryJewana	Who the f let you into my house?
Lvke	who allowed you to film my home? 👀
Ben R.	This is just stupid. This isn't what you call living. This is more like the devil's home. Reminds me of ancient slave peasant owners. This is sad to be honest. It should make every sad by a morale code of human decency.
Petare Pimenta	Insane and that’s crazy! The most popular words in this video
ignacio a	So looks like I could live in that house with my  family side from mom and dad ... to fill up that big mega mansion ...and still going to be big ...I can’t imagine power bill in that house lol

Followyourideas (Aikido Shodokan)	Absolutely no class
alloutloljohn	With $188 Million, I'd rather build my own dream house and deck it out with things I like.  Fuck buying that house then having to hire a crane to remove that hideous giant camera.
Mahmut Yilmaz	If everyone who watched this gave me a dollar I’d be a millionaire- my PayPal is mahmutyilmaz1634@gmail.com
Buddies App	Unless you have a lot of friends you want in your house, all the time, you will live in a fancy hotel... alone.
D A	or you could leave the beautiful stone in the ground instead of carving it into some louis vuitton rip off shite
Dennis Durkop	Better to rent and invest the rest! No worry about employees and maintenance of this liability when the prices collapse! Inflation bearing its ugly head right now! Or I guess one could get married and the lady of the house takes it in divorce settlement! Good reason never to marry in the West! MGTOW!
Alix Ondro	must be like 2 million just alone in yearly taxes .... I think I am going to put a down payment on this crib i do have 1 million I think it's enuff for a down payment and just wait till I get evicted it will be worth it and just lose a million dollars after all I will still have 2 million dollars left so yes I have a 750 credit and 1 million dollars sowing me in
Edgar Martinez	Whomst tryna recreate Raid from BO2 in real life
Charlie Harris	If a purge ever happens this will be the first place I'm raiding
EL Ian	Ryan over in my future haven la la la land looking at one of my future homes in the hills. Lol.  Maybe once the wheels are in motion we will be looking at a couple of future partners like Josh and we together can make that $1,000,000,000 a year per firm into like $10,000,000,000 or more who knows. Ha. Ha. So amazing seeing someone as awesome as Ryan in the hills. His little article that was published about when he entered real estate in 08 during the recession and his beginnings was absolutely life changing for myself much like Josh's story.Didn't sound like he was flat lined like some of us fell to in our humble beginnings but regardless the harder the fall the sweeter the rise will be. Great video.
Hello TV	Beyonce was playing and on the TV....im pretty sure it’s her

chandler bing bong	crazy, insane, awesome... he said it 188 million times
Vic Vic	This mainson just screams "I'm a tasteless, stupid, superrich person and have no idea what else to do with my money". Most of the stuff looks really crazy in a bad sense of the word. It seems to be very typical American, it's a show, it's mental to be shown off.

Emil	The bathroom alone is 3 times more expensive than my house
BTC STACKER	$188 Million mansion surrounded by a shitty cloud of L.A. pollution.... No thanks!!
Greed Unlimited	DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETER  THAN THIS ?
AgAiNsT87	this is why the world is as it is today a few people having way too much money they need to give all but 10 million thats not too much to ask and what you can do with 10 million i think its enough  and if we take all this money from them free food and education for everyone on the world but no here we are celebrating some ones elses richness just sad
Fruit's Dad	Soooo... did your client buy it?
Ezio K	I mean I've seen a lot pointless shit, but this... Overwhelmingly pointless.

ASMR Senpai	a year ago this was $250... daim they dropped the price, seems like nobody wants it :D (I mean i would take it for 800 Dollars wich i had to work 3 weeks for xd)
News Update	its really cool but it wouldn't make me happier than a $1 million mansion.
gwimmer98	This house has a lot of things, but the three things it lacks are taste, elegance and understatement.
jbreakstone	Perfect house for Kim & Kanye....  No taste, but screams to everyone “LOOK WHAT I GOTS!!”
Marc Mescher	Living’ on the fault line.
Anna Cooper	Beyoncé in the background😂
tenzin tseyang	Saw this house for sale priced at 250 mil. 188 mil now? Lol .  Maybe 60 mil next time ?
Arsagard Lim	how big do you need a house to be? you're gonna be lonely af. Imagining walking down the hallway alone. Spooky
Seni Joshua	Watching the Superbowl with 40 of your friends? Umm which adult has 40 good friends? I think in their attempt to validate the monstrous price tag, they added a lot of pointless stuff. It reeks of overkill. I mean two  wide screen TVs facing each other? This house is only good for a short-term rental for a billionaire to throw a week long party.
kid chill	Thumbnail look like gta v graphics
Storm Negele	This house dropped 70 million dollars bc it used to be 250 million. I'm guessing that it will drop again before it sells.

Jacob Federici	I love how *a fucking sink* in one bathroom costs as much as my house.
Davor Marjacic	insaine
Gian-Luca Nardini	can this guy say anything apart from crazy or insane? fucking useless
vince m	This isnt even a house.  A house has useful things, it has memories, it has character.  This is a conglomeration of "give me the most expensive crap money can buy".   Oh its ugly as fuck. But costs 3 million, give me 2 of them, but hand carve 1 of them.  "This us the fastest motorcycle in the world, but it will never be driven again" why the fuck do you own it?  Look at my suede lined drawers in my walk in closet, I dont have anything in my drawers though because that would cover up the suede.  So much dumbass shit.  Lol
Pewterschmidt	yo, who cares if the house is overpriced, whoever has the money and buy it, is for ostentation.. i mean.. no one will buy it becouse its worth it..
MKMB Studio	it's a stupid waste of money OR the perfect home for tasteless billionaires. Seriously... Who would want to buy a house where everything is already there?  What super cool hypercars or collector models do you want? - Nevermind, the garage is already full. What interior do you prefer? - Nevermind, 2M $ staircase around a gigantic weird camera already in it.  Just dumb.
DavisAutoSports	Someone give that guy another adjective.
WazzUppFLO	Only people I respect is those who build that.

Yamalkoo	ryan oh crazy wow insane all worlds he could put together :D shame
brontox095	This mansion is the epitome of profligacy; it is a recklessly extravagant and wasteful investment, and it does not look particularly harmonising. I would much rather live in a Mediterranean-style house in Beverly Hills.
Christian Karlsson	But why?
MarjanManuk	Nonsense...to me....such a loss of money

311i0t	take a shot every time he says "insane"

Aesthetic Pepe	For  $188 mio i would want my own Racing track, Roller coaster, Amusement facility , whatever...  but not this pointless overpriced garbage to look at...
Jared Black	Just in my opinion I would never waste money like this when there are so many people struggling just to see the next day. I would be investing it in programs to help others not indulge in selfish riches. BUT that's JUST MY OPINION.
Andy Holmes	It's even got AIRWOLF parked in the garden :O
Swiss Provider	With tax, security, insurances, this place draws from your pocket at least  5M/year...

Benjamin Kolls	Basically the only thing I would buy if I won a $1 billion power ball. Literally comes with everything you'd want to buy anyways.
Better With Rum	In the 11mins this video played,  3,300 children died from hunger. If I had the money, I'd buy this place sell-off ever bit for as much as possible and end hunger. This is a complete waste.
sickasso72	what projector did he say?

William Felix	I guess only a multi billionaire could live in one. A celebrity would go broke.
Nando Yale	I love luxury listings  73 crazy’s
eric moss	So, it's a luxury hotel for the most self-absorbed human on the planet.  I mean, there are a lot of million dollar tschotchkes, but a museum of vanity pieces seems a lot more empty than a nice cabin in the mountains.
Colleen Bowerman	Nothing interesting about this house besides the fact that it costs $188 million. It lacks style, personality, or anything interesting about it. It's for rich people that don't know what else to do with their money.
nigling	the house kinda sucks , anyone else think so? I mean with so many millions its very bland
tascabron teclados	I prefer the Mansion up in heaven..this one is nice but will rotten with time

Subesh Babu P	It was $250M just a year ago..
Chase Parker	My favorite part of the property is the view and the heli that comes with it. Really cool.
Peefoe 5	He has a panoramic view of LA too bad it’s obscured by the smog.
epocs	a lot of that house is ugly and gaudy as fuck
Georgios Toumpaniaris	the reason they spend 300 milion on  boat and 30 on a house is becouse they get to use all the rooms of the boat even if i had hunundreds of billions therefore didnt care about upkeep or the buying price  i still wouldnt buy it cause more then 80% of the house would just be not used.
Kura Bujnu vo	there are few stuff in these house I would ask that agent to take it out. just to save a million dollar.
Halley Bengia	This house was up for 250 million  a few months ago.That's a great Halloween discount!

No Hope Equals no fear	What are property taxes on 188 million home
dorinha sanchez	beautiful house,love it.
Coover	I've seen a lot of mansions in my time. Sure this is nice, but has a lot of things that make it decorated to suit a personal taste. I would have thought a property on the market would be presented a bit more vanilla. A house this size in Australia could be bought for maybe $8-$10m tops (chopper and all). And they say Aussie house prices are ridiculously high (which they are!).
Calvin H.	You said it best! That's CRAZY!!
Psycho Bread	They wanted 250mil for that house not so long ago but nobody even that rich is stupid enough to buy it for that loads of useless shit in that house “oh look an 80k anchor” nobody gives a fuck get me 12 Victoria secret models and 3kilos

Art Deco	Just obscene.
Stevey TeeVee	4:45 holy shit it looks like a mall.
Oby One	Talk about filled with completely uselesss shite. I'd end up using one room in that place, plus the helicopter. That little old sales dude actually seemed to believe his hype. What a loads of horse sh*t. Pure greed. That house is worth not even half of what they are asking for it. I reckon about 50mill at best.
THEdragonslayrr _	Why does no one show the master suite? This one showed the closets, but not much else.
Omar Abdullah	I just bought this house guys.
Alec Dukas	If you guys could live in the Matrix, take the blue pill and wake up in the master bedroom of this mansion would you?

ken masters	got to run alot of coke across the border to afford this badboy.
Captain Z	Only 188 pffff pocket change
Justin B	The way I think, I'd sell this property, buy a much smaller, cheaper property for myself, buy 10 investment properties and have $120M left over.
Luxagon	That point in your life when "350" refers to 350 mil, I'm just trying to get to the point where 350 doesn't mean $3.50
reekashade	No stripper pole...
Dick Cheneh	ok but does it have a dedicated jerk off room

My room is only 2x2, I cannot stand that I bet is millions of people like me, and we can make a big difference if we stick together, only is need to keep sharing similar kind of message like mine and talk to people, spend as much time is possible to talk to people and tell them, is no need to go f fighting or any agresion evrione can make a difference from them living room sat comfortably bihaind the screen!

Dante Beats	......Crazy
Kiran Martin	total BS proposition that real estate in LA is a good investment; it's a high risk investment and a sure loss over time for 99% of luxury sales. Most people who piss their money away know better anyways. Real state agents are so commonly snakes in the grass.

Deathrun C	Yall, I got a question....    Why?
Gab Labrador	Wasn't this 250 million?
Danny Sands	The only problem with living in a house like this is the fact that are tons and tons of strangers that work there, and stuff is always going on. It doesn't seem very "homely"

Seth Bishop	188 million on a shallow house or start a spaceship company and a electric car company just to prove it can be done?
Draxis32	Robot personality: That's crazy That's insane. That's crazy That's insane. *suddenly a pop ad shows up* Only today 50$ dollar discount on SPEECH DLC 2.0
brakasoft	But the map for the house is surely 10 $ hidden extra cost. Not with me! ;-)
bodybuilder26us	a moron would purchase items that were specifically designed for others...    i buy the house but not the stupid decorations and art or even the stupid helicopter..  Seller is pushing their waste of money to the new buyer, personal property and art that they dont' want.     Who is the moron who is going to buy all that stuff..
rskrks	I'm watching my usual car racing channel and then Ryan shows up in the up next. Wtf Serhant u got your own YouTube channel now eh.
I COME FROM SUN	*Serotonin/endorphins defines good mood, not a house* They are the things that make us appreciate things. I would pay 60 million dollars to become 43 years younger again. At 67 years of age 10 million dollars is equal to 12 000 dollars when you're 23. After 80 there is no point in buying anything. The big mansion thing works until you're 65. Just sharing some "secret" info guys :)
Liam White	This guy Ryan has as much personality as a donkey with 1 leg as ebola
InternetXplorer	This will eventually become a boutique hotel ☺

Jack Kendahal	It actually looks like cheap.... the colors and so on, so shallow, so little taste... how can someone spend so much money with so little taste.... Maybe you should sell it to a russian oligarque, they're into bling and maybe have enough liquidities.  It looks like a glorified luxuous shopping mall.  check this out, still expensive but well.... got more soul in it :  https://www.archdaily.com/294077/the-factory-ricardo-bofill/50a48227b3fc4b263f000022-the-factory-ricardo-bofill-photo
khwaac	Awkward hug at the end. Murica. No class.
Emperor Beaducwealm	Doesn't seem too practical, and it seems way too personalized to sell at that cost. Those useless modern art pieces seem like big gaudy objects to tack on to the value of the place. 21 bathrooms? Fuck, since when would I ever need that. A movie theater? I'd rather just chill in bed with a beer in my hand watching something on a nice 4k screen then watch something in a big ass empty theater.  And fuck, the place is so big and bloated with shit that will become outdated in a few years that I would constantly need workers inside cleaning, replacing, and maintaining shit, so there goes my privacy.
David Fuxjaeger	So the mansion was new 250 million and is now 188 million i tought estate rise in beverly hills?
jody 107	never even on a boat 4fs
t0nda	What did I just watch? A tour in the museum of just-standing-there stuff, without further use? I mean, it is certainly not the worst idea to spend on real estate, but there is a major hook with this one: It consumes too much money each and every day: maintenance, staff, security, utilities. Plus, it is not the real estate which drives the price, but it is the interior design. Which has little of an additional use, most things are just props for meeting another alleged superlative. Personally, I feel that that mansion is just uncozy, a patchwork of expensive wannabe items which just do not fit (in my eyes). There are a lot of tasteful expensive mansions around, but this to me seems just cobbled together in a giant shopping spree only looking for price tags, but not for looks.  Perhaps the tour would have been more convincing if held based on a social event in some gemütlich fireplace room. Just have a nice 20-people party and show how the mansion does when put to use. If there is any room which feels liveable, that is. Because as an asset to invest in, it does not seem straightforward. High running costs, and the main part of the money does not even seem to be real estate, but props which may and will drop in value most probably. Even if I liked the artwork or items in it, I would just purchase those which I like, but not the whole package.  Good luck selling it. It certainly has some nice aspects in spite of all my criticism.
fevialmd	I have seen this house before in porn movies

Régis	Typical example of how money doesn't buy classiness.
RifiFeooo	First of all , someone that has that kind of money to buy such a house , doesnt spend much time at home. Secondly that has so many       features that in the end it becomes pointless. I mean of course billionaires have crazy houses and yachts and  other stuff but that is an  exaggeration. Why have a 30 seat cinema in your house instead of a 10-15 for example.  Imagine living on your own there. How many times are you gonna have company to enjoy all these. You are constantly reminded that you are alone. Its depressing. Only Dan Bilzerian with his 20 chicks would use that space. Otherwise I fail to see the point.
Lithian Haim	It's hilariously fugly. If someone has that much time and money to buy the space the craftsmanship, why not hire someone who actually has taste? Just compare this to the home of an aristocrat, makes this look a heap of rubble, although the base materials are similar high class. The prettiest room was the closet! By far!
TheFinalRevelation	Amazing. When you build something so expensive, people pay you to showcase it in their videos. Amazing.

Tibly	This real estate true value is only 88 million dollars.
José Pedro Filipe	From 250 to 188 that’s a massive discount :) Love the art pieces around the house.
Imre Petrohai	all of you that say this is a cool house - I think it's actually pretty sad. Especially the fact that 99% of a house like that most likely not in use 99% of the time. I understand art and uniqueness but it's insane (yes, I said insane as well but in a different meaning) that a small group of people in the world is capable of using wealth such way and not think about others who live on $1 a day in other side of the world. Maybe when that guy made an offer on that 1 million dollar shiny piece of crap camera could have thought - oh I could probably feed 1000 people in Western Africa for a year. How about that? Or establish a business in a third world country for locals that create an environment for them to rise from poverty. No, it's better to create a 250 million dollar monstrosity where you can put out fire with champagne - can they not see how gimmicky and ridiculous is that?
Antonije Velevski	I see this house is still on the market :P It has been for sale for a long time now. I guess there are VERY few people that are THAT stupid and THAT rich :)
Robert Prechter	188 million, so you can live in a museum....no thanks Jeff
aponcapone	Me, my wife and 2 little kids can not complain about our house. A house this big I would not know what to do with it. 12 bedrooms..... Yeah nice if you are with four people. All this bathrooms.... Yep let's shit in another one for the fun of it. I find it crazy. We have 2 bathrooms and that's enough. But if you have that kind off money who knows what I would buy but I can not imagine I would be happy that big of a house.
Dan	Such a shame they'll struggle to get their money back on this house. It's pretty awful design-wise
Nino Vleesenbeek	dan bilzerian
voice of reason	To me this house is like a great museum. I want to look at everything but I wouldn't want to live there.
Faizan Siddiqui	The Agent says that the Mansion’s price won’t drop it’s value in 10 years But the same mansion was priced at $250 Million just a year ago 🤔 I mean l’m in no way thinking if buying this because my whole life only worth a Happy Meal But just thought to point it out 🙏😭😭😭🙏
John Taylor	Very Cool and stuff but 1/ The Big Camera is a flippin eye sore! A million quid!? Sell it and give the money to charity. 2/ Who want's someone else buying their Car's? 3/ Who picks the Chopper Pilot? Cause that landing bay is the size of a chess board!?. 4/ If you offered that guy $50,000,000, he'd snatch your hand off!!...

Duh!
shamailah1	Useless shit !
Tobias Ungerböck	Do a Giveaway or something

memlafeder	That is the most uncouthness, unsophisticated taste, that money can buy. I have no problem  with the price of the house. You may be rich, and you buy a house even for a billion. That is not the case. But creating lots of bull shit, made from expensive materials, which has no practical use or a tiny bit of joy for your eyes, or lots of unnecessary and wasted shit that costs a lot to made, to be presented as art but a fart in reality etc. etc. Dude.. this is bigotry and being a dumb nouveau-riche at its peak.
THATSMYNAME	TASTE, CLASS, Call it what You want, that place has nothing, You can tell the owner has no Soul and a empty Heart sad really. KEEP IT
michaelovitch	Half the price is useless bullshit in this thing.
imhoman	if i had 200mil i'd carefully choose the architect, my advisors and the materials and build it "myself". then i'd fill up the garages with the toys i want to see, in the colours i want them to be. if i'd have 200 mil i wouldnt want all this spoonfed to me. #igotthis
Max Heidcase	I feel sorry for anyone who would want to live like this
UNITED WORLD OF AMERICA ΩusaΩ	180million and all i got is 40 dollars for work gas. can any of you billionaire spare me a 50,000 dollar mobile home so i can stop slaving my life away paying rent. ill be your yes sir no sir for life.  make a lifeless  man live free again.
DariusCZH	wtf this mansion i pretty similar to Notch's mansion
GOOB THE GOOFY GOOBER	And to think that this kind of money is like pennies to some people is disgusting
Matthew Wallace	Insanely wasteful. Living a life of pure indulgence and owning ornaments that just sit on the floor and represent your status is just tragic. The value of that pathetic oversized camera, would equate to 750,000 meals. If I was a billionaire and bought this house, I would struggle to live with the pain in my gut when looking around at the wasteful value of my surroundings. Everyone who earns their money has the right to spend it as they wish, but for me, I couldn't live with it.
recon forsales	Even Bill Gates could not even afford a house like this!

No Name	The closet is bigger than my apartment.

Maxi Kabutz	What's the song at the end of this video called?
Andrew Lang	$2 million stair case......   .....wanna see something crazy? Speakers” 😂
Squid Girl	Honestly, I feel like I'd be really lonely in a house that big. Give me all that money and I'd buy a somewhat large home and be happy for the rest of my life. But I guess when you're that stupidly wealthy you're in a completely different mindset that regular poor people like me... I mean, $300k vanity? Come on now, you don't need that shit.
Ricardo gonzalez	Maldita pobreza
Hopeful Interpretation	It's a house not a home.

NA NA	So much money for an ugly tacky overpriced stack boxes. Funny the way the rich place value on the bland and soulless.
Milen Metodiev	Who is considered rich in the world,who gives to the people like Google,Facebook,Microsoft,  PayPal and others.

稲森愛新	lets say you have a billion dollars. 188 mil goes to the house.  bills taxes (incl. vehicles) cleaning service maintenance (incl. tech maintenance) security outside maintenance (incl. gardening and all that) house this big needs actual managers, plural. heating & cooling  all these are extremely expensive. It wastes SO MUCH energy aswell, which planet needs. it is extremely big that it is overwhelming. even if I had 500 billion dollars, I wouldn't give a penny for this house. and I fucking mean it. I'd actually go nuts. absolutely nuts. just managing and keeping up with this place is a goddamn nightmare. not even a pet would be able to live in this house why a simple luxury penthouse with a nice wide swimming pool and a huge yard isnt enough? This house will never ever sell. waste of LAND this space. its just a museum / art gallery.
RepublikofMancunia 20	This house is shit. I’ve seen $10-20m homes that are much nicer

Burst Nibbler	Wow, I'm poor but I don't care because I feel richer than this dude even with all his tasteless tat (and let's face it, it's all just stuff that you look at once or twice and feel empty inside afterwards, well I would..).  How about actually spending quality time being relaxed, having a good belly laugh with the ladies down the pub, maybe getting lovin' at the end of the night!  Ah the thrill of the chase, nothing beats that feeling for free...go figure!
Andrew Gene	Tacky.  As they say, money can't buy taste.
Roskoe P	How to waste 188$ million, DYI. This is how to do it.

Neo*UPR*2022	Wasting Earth masterpiece to make this sort of useless and stupid crap *faith in humanity instant loss*
Matt Pannell	Ryan Reynolds’s new house.
HILDA SHAFER	this house is ludicrous
K 00	180Million$ But they used shitty cold and bright spotlights on the entire ceiling.
Thomas	188 million dollar house review and can't even get a sock for the mic?
losjorgos	I am really surprised. Just by accident I saw this. Ten years ago I shot a Marlboro campaign in there. the house was rented out as a movie set too. It was slightly run down. They couldn't find a buyer. Probably it was on the market for a good price. The premises are quiet small, but the house huge. They added the structures close to the pool and and damn that house got a make over. The interior looked completely different. I still have pictures of it.
SoCalFreelance	Are they still trying to sell that place!? 0_o  Or has it been flipped so many times the greater fool theory keep trucking along.
Amenhotep Pimpernel III	188 milion
surfkillen	This house totally lacks charm, it sure looks good for house partys, but for permanent residentce regardless of price, no thanks.
gerard . A	Hope it will never sell and just rot away , yup , apart the price tag I don’t think it’s a special house at all , most of the price chunk is because of the so called art shit that is inside , for that price you can get a bigger house with a fucking not one Picasso but two if you really like art , and yes their price will never drop and you get to admire theme every day :-)
Chase Hovey	is it for sale still?
lameck k	...and it comes with a chopper
DJ Rezurekt	I rent out Fincas like this in Colombia twice a year. This is one of the top ones.
nerea oshla coetzee	Wtf   ....ill use it as a hotel...house way overated

whoopn	Theater could've been done better, screen size to room depth was off
denmark39	188 mill and I don’t like it! On top of it I have to listen to a real estate broker talk about economics 🤮
Touge Media	I would be mad that I couldn’t choose what to do everyday
SquintyHeart	Wouldn’t pay 188mil for that even if i could afford it
lilmaestro	I'm gonna say this right now this house is actually disgusting looking. The amount of misplacement of material and object makes it look more like an art piece in a museum. Not in a good way either.
Stevie Z	haha "watching the superbowl with 40 of your closest friends" well sure dude^^
Dennis Jørgensen	That's crazy
Mr. Complicated	That house is nice but full of kitsch and trash. It would cost more to remove all these things than the empty house itself. :D
lokolop1	The pretentiousness emanating from this bald guy is painful.
Djoni Lim	Wowwww, then speechless....
GameDevMoto	Never have I seen a house that has tackier decor.  Guess money can't buy taste. I'd keep the cars...
Chino780	Who lives there?
Peggy Bagley	Wow it's so damn crazy crazy crazy crazy
Kyle 0161M22	How anyone can think spending this amount of money on a house is stupid when you can spend that money on more investment homes and make even more money, yes it would take a while for your $188 million investment to come back to you but you know that you will continue to make more every week, month and year after that.
Mj	Crazy, awesome, insane, ok.
Kal2019	Fine I'll take it. Do you accept Visa or prefer cash?
ReaZaaa	Deadmau5' mansion is betta!
Vincent Palmieri	Piece of shit house
For Grim til TV	Yo Ryan! Dope video. Tell your videoguy to buy a Sony fs5 or fs7, so he can mic up the both of you. Got those two cameras myself and they're awesome! And remember that audio is half the experience and this was.... well not good.
focusboy	That Sora Electric Motorcycle is one of the slowest electric motorcycles on earth. Fucking Idiot doesnt know the difference between KPH and MPH
ASIF VIRK	Shut up and take my money I'll give you CASH. I thought it was $250,000,000. Beautiful Pease of ART the whole house is.

sidney hardman	AT A 35% TAX BRACKET YOU MIGHT BE PAYING $12 MIL IN TAX EVERY YEAR. OVER 20 YEARS THATS $ 240,000,000 IN TAXES ALONE. NOT COUNTING THE MONTHLY BILLS AND INSURANCE THATS WHY THIS HOUSE HAS NOT SOLD. EVEN A BILLIONAIRE WOULDN'T TOUCH THIS MONEY PIT. HELL BUFFETT WOULDN'T TOUCH IT ESP AS AN INVESTMENT BECAUSE SELLING IT WOULD BE AT A GREAT LOSS. MEANING IF HE SOLD IT AT 42 MILLION HE'D LOSE $146,000,000.
inthekitchen2	I noticed that when the bald guy is touching the(very valuable) fixtures and other things in the house he's very casual about letting his ring knock against the surfaces
Evidence	How do they keep that house clean?
Beautiful	The guy has a bigger ego than the house.
Shiran	With 188 mil I would buy a damn Island.
Cannalingus	Dude you couldn't have been a little more inquisitive? I wanted to hear what the guy was explaining about the house... he gave up telling you cuz you weren't giving him anything back besides "INsane". I love luxury listings.
rahma4	The amount of tacky shit in that house was astonishing... That amount of money, and you plaster your house with designer-emblazoned, custom-designed sculptures of simply cringe-worthy crap..  Nice house 'n all, but the gimmicky crap was off the charts. Simply devastating to watch.
sean thompson	I suspect he is exaggerating on the motorcycle's 0-60 time. Even if he means 0-60kmh, instead of mph, in under 3 seconds.
mórk EMS	40 of your closest friends more like 40 hot women lols
i_Robo	400 mil jade piece, 188 mil house? something aint right here chief....

J-O	$4 Mil for a used Bugatti Veyron? Maybe if it's all gold...

Jack Smith	“How many bathrooms are in the house?”  “21” Me: *YOU STUPID* Rich guy: *Na I’m not*
Srchangwaytogo C.	What is the structure made of? Wood, steel or concrete?
Eldric Lee	It's for rich man for wild party...
transamination	Ryan is very good at not looking impressed at all. 'Wow' 'insane' 'that's awesome' in a totally flat voice with no facial expression.
Stephen ORiorden	Would you say it's "insane" Ryan?  How does this guy who in unexpressive, unimpressed and out of words have a vlog?
Pig0Benis88	Jeff Bazos makes $275 million a day.

NewWayEarners	The guy buying the house has a vocabulary of 3 words, "Insane, nuts, & crazy," proving you don't need to be a grammar god to be a millionaire :)
Jacob Largosit	One day ☝️ mark my words
Jeremy LaFave	What's the name of the song at the end
Robert Willis	If, If, I had won the lottery and bought this house, I would be selling most of the crap trinkets off (except the cars). That could be a nice house without most of the stupid stuff.  Massive camera, pictures of syringes etc.
Don't Judge APS	Still they have no buyer 🤣😂🤣 ! I watched this last 2 year ago !
2dgamemania	screen looked small in the cinema room!  i liked the screen by the pool and all that wine  :)

yossef woretaw	it's crazy how some people got so much money and just keep on buying  usless stuff but got 0$ to help kids in 3erd world countries that really need help :( for sure you see them people buying the most luxury stuffs in the world that most people cant buy but except Bill Gates i never see none of them giving the world biggest donation? why? i want to know why they don't do something nice like that?
you Han	Imagine living in there forever  I am sorry but I can't.  I will get bored and I'd want to go home within month. That's not a way of living  For vacation yes but not more than that

Asa Durham	"And again..."  "Insane""Like I said...."  "Crazy"
Darko Ilievski	I dont like this shit. People dont have food to eat but this one  is crazy ehat the hell
German Cericos	Oh my bad thought the old guy was Gennaro Contaldo hahaha
horse1066	Hollywood's idea of what constitutes "art" is just laughably vulgar. Assuming I had the money, I'd expect all that tat to be in a dumpster before I'd move in. Décor clearly aimed at Arabs and no one else.
Razer Gecko	5:36 wtf is this BS 400mil fuck off house is 250
Miikeey	What do you have to do have a house like this, which decision do you have to take, that we didn’t?
David Obinna	They would make more money by turning it into a museum because lets be honest, no one is going to buy and live in this house.
Harry	You have the vocabulary of a pre-schooler.
6 O’glock	“40 of your closest friends”
Myles Platt	These things are made for someone to enjoy...why not you?

cebrail onlu	The question that popped out of my head after watching this video for 5 minutes and 36 secondes was.       Who do you have to be or become to have this?
Victor Manuel	Absurd waste of money. It's probably the annual budget of some little country to maintain all its workers and infrastructure, but put just at a house... certainly insane.
Niels Larsen	That is one tasteless ugly ass house
Mohammad Khalid	I heard only one word ...That was irritating . @crazy
Sofronique	Amazing tour of Bill Gates guest bedroom!
Alan H	Shame it’s in America, rest of world will soon go to war with TRUMP.

Tony Mendez	Sure
efraim asoy	hi po kuya!! wow that house is so huge and so nice!! watching ur vlog from the Phil.. btw, who lived that house?
Einhärjar	No matter how much money I'd have I'd never buy a hoise like that. Just excessive useless crap really. I'd rather spend the money to buy land and live in the middle of nowhere. The best part is that the peopel who want the most open borders etc. are the ones living in these armed guard castles.
Waleed Banjar	yeah i have one like that,, in The Sims
Wizold Sage	I admire these swanky looking places but honestly If I had a house it would be more wooden and homely and warm.
Thirsty	can someonepleaseexplain whyon earth a billionaires work of art with family heirlooms ect is for sale?....and a measly 188m... these people are actually insane.
david42na	you are touring "a massive 188 mio worth mansion", but still using free fonts on your thumbnail

Brad Kannry	Who the hell drinks martinis during the superbowl.
Corteney Bohne	And yet we have humans starving of hunger?

Brett Robbins	07:25 subtext: you don't look nearly excited enough about all this money-dropping talk I'm engaging in.
Guerilla Movies	Sad that someone needs this to make their life fulfilled.
Mesheck Mwangi	theres an easy way to afford this house just download A cheat trainer and use unlimited money cheats 9999999999.
Lemmy Valentine	I thought Jay and Bey already bought this place
John L	Its more like an amazing office space... not really getting a home vibe
Scott Hetherington	imagine taking that camera on pawn stars, guarantee only worth 10-25 grand if that... and the staircase about 60-120 k but since some people have more money than sense 2 million sounds appropriate.
Beer Money Forum	I don't like it because there's no airport for my private jet I don't have.
Santiago de Santa Catalina	regular life is not sad my friend
Mary Ellen Brixey	How bout how many times you said “sure”!😂
sabbel babbel	Money doesnt buy happiness but id rather be lonely in my 188 million mansion than on the street
Moa	im going to buy this house :)
Rendroc	Holy shit, I want that house, just m and my harem. But fucking hell, there's starving children out there being forced into prostitution where they are raped and murdered and instead of helping people are spending this amount of crazy money on themselves. LOL, the world is so fucked. 😁

justin rock	council!!
philfy23	Fuck that.... hope they drown in their own money whoever buys that.
Dave Harkin	I live in a one-bedroom flat struggling to make ends meet. Why? Because I'm honest and you'll never get anywhere in this life being honest.but I have a clean conscience knowing that I haven't ripped anybody off or hurt anybody. there's only so much money in circulation, the more one person has. Then ,more people have to do without.he spends 400 million On a stone, that would house and feed many people in the world seems to me that crime and get out of my way attitude whilst I climb the money ladder and kick everybody else off,seems to work in this insane world.the more money they have, the more they want their never happy with the money they have. I think that MOST rich people cannot have a conscience and not care about other people they just Wanna spend it all on themselves. If I had his money I'd get happiness in helping others.instead of spending 400 million On a stupid stone. That's why the guy in the video keep saying "Crazy" because that is exactly what it is.
James Schmidt	This is hard to watch for me. Not because I hate those who have more than me but because I am mad at myself for still struggling when clearly the money is out there to be made but I have yet to find my direction. Props to the % of life that can experience such things though. Most are self made and you have to respect it even if it hurts.
LanceGameEverything	They just called me poor for 11:00 minutes
Ayo_iitzYeBoiiPotato Gaming	*Whistle* Thats insane! Crazy.

Adam R	One has millions others hv nothing
Jared Kloos	If everyone thats already watched this video put in 63 dollars we could all share it just sayin
Janusha	Thats a REPLICA of the Airwolf helicopter. So it doesnt actually fly. 50 sportscars and motorcycles you cant drive, a million bottles of drinks you wont drink... What a bunch of bullshit. This is luxury just for the sakes of luxury. Its like buying into somebody elses wet dreams. And no. Thats not a 4 million dollar Bugatti.
Smotherd666	yep buying it now

Mark Wang	Man I love these luxury listings

Andrew12064	Somebody used hacks
RightFootForward11	The house has so much tech it is going out of date every few years. Incredible cost to maintain its worth
Michael m	Now the real question is WHO LIVES HERE ??
DarkWater4Eva	For a lower price I can go without all that unnecessary shit like a big ass model of a camera and  carved stones.
B Devine	imagine caring about money this much? sad sad people.
YaBoiiJuan	My question is why?
IwillBwaiting	When you purchase a boat , after 1 year , and after 5 years , bla bla bla . 250 million minus 188 million leaves one with a bit of a loss it seems , in that steady Dow Jones beating market ...
MrMackanno	SO ridiculous, couldn't watch to the end.

Josh H	think of how many malnourished, displaced lost children  the owner of this house could support
MuscleDaddy	It's an ugly house though. Sorry. It is.
momo taher	baller
Pit Viper	Nothing like a waste of money. Cali is so good at it too. They want to tell the rest of the world how to live when they live like that. I would never live there especially in the south. All the water has to be pumped in right along with most of the electricity. Once this world goes to shit (soon I think) LA will make the Middle East look like Disney Land.
AmpireU	Yeah but your over looking your neighbors and smog the view sucks and not to mention LA is about to fall off the map all that money...waste
tony hernandez	Only very tiny few can reach that level of whealty😯. I will probably have to die a million times before I get there
Marcos Rodriguez	the person who built and paid for that has probably made the worst investment in history. I don't see that selling for more than 10 million. Imagine you buy this, who do you sell all that crap to, who would pay a million for that giant camera for example? How do you even get rid of the cars and the fake helicopter?
SarulaPlays	"This is the worlds fastest motorcycle in the world"
yondaime hokage	Bruce Wayne's house

Darius Brigham	I call dibs
chuckie14469	One earthquake later there goes 188 million dollars
Bob Schmidt	Or, because whoever built this did it to make money, just build your own for 188m and design it however you like. But, that car showroom is amazing.
Davide Di Perna	This is nicer than what my character has in GTA V
Nicholas von Perfall	Say crazy, nuts, or insane one more time I dare you
Guðmundur Sigurðarson	forty friends? a person with that kind of money is lucky to have one real friend.
ZeFancyWhale	Yet a house in Las Vegas with 21k square feet is 8 million...
Shnaz Fangler	This isnt cool, its a disgusting example of human greed. Flaunt your little dick house somewhere else.
claude nobs	what sad fuck will need that house..
Candy Apple	Very cool. Time to dream very big.
Bill Addison	So why are they selling all this shit?
George Taylor	Plain and simple, WHY?
Meda Tube	Fire the cameraman!! 😡😡

Mark Hogan	and there are millions and millions of people starving to death
john jj	All I see is a plain house with a bunch of overpriced useless crap trying to be sold by a salesman.
YUBIA	I'll feel so lonely in that place
ArthurMcAryan McNuggers, black ones	I want to live in a small house, who cares about diamonds, and fucking louis vuitton shit
Blake Bilodeau	This house is for the person/people that have so much money they don't know what to spend it on. The technology in the house is cool, but just so many pointless things that are there just to say "Hey look how rich I am". Like the gigantic camera at the bottom of the staircase or all of the carved stone luggage. Maybe I'm just jealous, but I could find at least 188 other things to spend a million on lol.
Mad man	it's unnecessarily to buy a 188 m house if u can have a 200t hose and be more happy! and still have monny over for cars and funn!
Leslie Martin	ABSOLUTELY UN NECESSARY!!  BAD-ASS IF YOU CAN BUT SERIOUSLY?? IF THESE RICH PEOPLE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND THEIR MONEY, LET IT BE KNOWN , I COLD USE SOME FINANCIAL HELP. I MEAN IT. I WORK, I PAY FOR MY OWN BUT MY AGE AND HEALTH ARE TAKING ITS TOLL ON ME AND I COULD REALLY USE A DUMP OF CASH TO BUY A NICE HOME, CAR AND BE COMFORTABLE WITHOUT SUCH WORRY.

EveningWind	More money than brains. It actually looks pretty tacky.
Chorkaloopa	Crazy insane? No. Wicked awesome!
Pastor Amos Carmichael	So happy for all the Family, my dream home too, God Bless keep the good videos coming
Bankole Anthony	cool house, but am I the only one thinking a gym ought to have been there and probably a game room with snooker, table tennis depending o what ever the owner likes... just thinking out loud.
Todd Secor	Every time he says a price on something I just shake my head. He either got ripped off on everything or is trying to up sell the house.
djmocok	If I want to find my sibbling I might have to actually call from phone
FuriouslyFurious	I could have hosted this walk around.  "Insane"...."crazy"...."awesome"...."wow"...."bonkers"..."crazy."
Eric VT	"INSANE"
Alex 234180	"That's insane" every 10 seconds.
bernieboy	The house belongs to Notch, the creator of Minecraft

BubaHigh	DrDisrespect w/o a wig  ?
SBVCP	Even if was multimillionaire...i dont think i would own a massive mansion. What for? is way too big unless you do parties every single day or live in a really really big family.   I would prefer to haev smaller houses ("small") all over the world to a) vacation,aand b) rent
Busani Ndlovu	"crazy".."insane"
Maximilian Walter	I got a chance to tour this home a few months ago and can say that this video shows off some of the cool "objects" of the house, but to really experience how incredible the dimensions, views (on a nicer day), and overall magnificence of this place is you just have to see it in person, it truly creates a "you are on top of the world" feel
AKBuilder762	looks tacky and a waste of money
Harshul Tandan	Crazy. Nuts. Sure.
Marquis Washington	Since i didnt hit the 1.6 billion i can't even do this no more

Eric Reyner	stupid never use 50% or more of the home

Jeff McDuffie	So what was in the room the camera wont allowed in?
PavlosP	probably one of the most kitsch things i've ever witnessed. It's like living in a restaurant.
Matthew Wiswesser	Why would you want this home in California when you could afford a home in Tahiti, Aspen, Jackson hole, etc. for the same price...
JohnnyClock	What a minute? The mansion doesn't come with its own Mc'Donalds??? Richie Rich has one!
Keep Calm Buddy	Anyway.anybody want some noodles.
STeeLo205 ImDatRapper	Just WoW....that's all I got...to say
S2 9ory	I don't like it, I'd rather have a cottage in the middle of fucking nowhere in Scotland.
C B	How owns This house ?
Luis Balmaceda	I LOVE 1MDL NY!!!!! ALL THREE OF YOU GUYS WERE AWESOME!!!!!
Don Mayers	Really I've been into Real estate a while and structurally its an architectural mishap, misappropriation of space, and just so many useless items / decor that you wouldnt care much about, if you guys love houses, check this out.. https://www.luxuryretreats.com/vacation-rentals/france/french-riviera/cannes-area/alang-alang-115488?src=disp_fcbk_dynamic-dat-rmkt_France-French-Riviera&utm_source=fcbk&utm_medium=display&utm_content=remarketing&utm_campaign=dynamic-dat-rmkt&utm_term=France-French-Riviera&fbclid=IwAR2rdnACRAPgQ7Ag9OTTxGMyrlRBYyL0MZkTW1UKuu1bBgCSL1wpWWTqFZE
Ian Pilgreen	Y'all need to work on your sound mixing
TrippyHobo	This would be the house if I could afford it .... not like im ever going to XD
tyler jackman	it was 12 times and if were not including the word craziness than 11
paradoxdesigns	Is this my GTA crib?
Solenn	looks like they had to lower the pricem form 250 million to 188 and i dont wonder why
MUSIKallDAY	i don't know why the fuck people would own houses with private cinemas, bowling stuff, cars for showcase to fuck knows,  i mean you just made A 188 million dollars purchase to be anti social or because you already are.
Fernando Martinez	I will take the house as a gift but I wouldnt purchase it.
kummer45	As an architect, that is one of the worst ways to waste energy, money and land. A good house for few people doesn't need much space. The bigger these are, the more maintenance, energy and cleaning they need.   Luxury is a waste.
alarsen21	Find inner peace and enlightenment and you could live in a shack and be happier than the owner of this house. You only need such extravagance if you have an inner hole you haven't yet realised can't be filled with material things
Al James	this is just excessive
Mike P.	Tour Guy: "this is the best residential movie theater in the world..." Ryan: "ok"
GORN	BOAT: Always the most efficient way to blow money, with blondes being a close second. Good luck with the listing. Personally, I'd use that guy. He's on top of things.
Maq T	anybody know the song at 5:30?
Javier Rivera 7470	I bet it was half tour
PopinBubbles	Your personality is so dry
felix crab	Kinda looks like a mid rate 5 star hotel with loads of bad art in it
Steven Koelewijn	Isn't this Dan Bilzarians house?
DEBBO8080	Dan Blizerian lives there now
TV SOUND SYSTEM	Insane - Crazy.......Oh he said that already
Jørn-Anders Gulbrandsen	patch
shahen sheikh	Money doesn't buy happiness but come on.......
Stephen Bennion	Why though. Like the camera doesn't even take a picture. And my $50 staircase works just as well as the $2,000,000 one HAhahhaa
Brahim Berrada El Azizi	I am gonna buy this Mansion by the end of next year (Dec. 2019) ICA :)
MrMaster1812	Didn't know DrDisRespect moved on from twitch!
gno1972	Okay how much is the house without the art?
Bunthan Sephieroth Kong	It’s so white
Koa Prather	This house wants Beyoncé to buy it lol
Brenden Moore	I am only 188 million dollars short, sorry!
Tom Stanton	I feel the guide is pulling numbers out of his ass everything he points to is 250,000 or more like okay man
Frauleinwunder07	Only 12 bedrooms?
Zoid Burg	That looks like the sort of house the loneliest man in the world would live in. You wouldn't enjoy any of that, you'd stick to one of your favourite cosiest rooms. I have 4 bedrooms, home cinema, gym, two living rooms and I spend 90% of my time in the office...
lakshmere	Overall, pretty tasteless imho, or let's say, not my taste.
Mike Oxlong	The amenities are top notch fantastic, but the architecture leaves something to be desired. I wouldn't turn the property down if it was gifted, but at the same time I'd sell it right afterwards for something more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Just saying.
joe r gonzales	The so called "heli-pad" is for display purposes only.  The Bell 222 is the original one used in the AirWolf series...so the helipad and helicopter is just for display purposes.  If you try to take off or land, you will be heavily fined by the city and possibly the FAA.  The house originally went for sale for $250 million a year ago.  It was owned by real estate developer Bruce Makowsky.  Imagine the mark-up on real estate to achieve this type of wealth....overpriced if you ask me but somebody paid for it.
Erik Hallberg	imagine being the schmuck that buys it
tinathomas689	Who is Bruce??
Alex Pacay	shure,ok,crazy crazy crazy crazy! bro can you say anything else, sorry sorry that was insane
youandiryan	Call me crazy. If i was extremely wealthy i would not own a house like this. To me this is stupid. Everyone has blood. And everybody goes to the same place when they die. Having a house like this doesn't really do anything for me. It's all for a fake facade that you're going to lose when your dead anyway. If I was this wealthy I would still be driving my Toyota Corolla and I would maybe have one really nice car and truck but that's about it. But I like the simple things in life and I like being humble. I enjoy going out and hiking and camping and doing my own dishes and driving myself around and not have somebody else do it for me like a baby. But I'm also not the type to go to fancy restaurants. It makes me uncomfortable and kind of disgusts me. But everyone has their own way of doing things so kudos to them

Da Vid	I would buy it...but its just too small for me.
James Halliday	Who's this "Bruce" bloke? Seems a lovely house, great location and all that, undoubtedly worth a fortune - but "Bruce" seems to have filled it with vile tat.
Casey Weitzel	All of that “art” is so stupid. The jade wall and the anchor are probably the only cool things, and they’re the cheapest!
TheGlorianos	It was $250M! Why reduced so drastically?
Drive it Like ya stole it	Nice domicile.  Too bad it's in California, land of liberals.
N Field	Hope its got 20 foot walls and security guards cause when the economy crashes and people realize its the gluttony of so few that have cost so many, I hope they drag every plutocrat into the streets and do them like Gaddafi.

David Barker	Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.  Here is my invite link: https://initiativeq.com/invite/r868c4Cj7   This link will stop working once I’m out of invites. Let me know after you registered, because I need to verify you on my end.

Easyy Bro	In January 2017 price for this mansion was $250 millions now after almost 2 years it on market for $188 million dollars.. so wait until its on sale for $ 1 million lol
Justin Leonard	So am I the only one that would just fly around in my helicopter drive my motorcycles and  50 cars, swim,  and say screw the rest of the house?😂😂😂

Jazleen Podraza	id rather split that money and have homes in diff parts of the world...so much money wasted in the house its not even nice just a bunch of expensive things combined...although the staircase was nice...
tommyboyuruguay	Does anyone know or have an estimate on how much it costs to keep it running for a month or a year?. I'm just curious, because you pay $188 million for a house, and then how much more a year to keep it pristine and running as perfectly as it is shown on this clip?
chloeyesha Balingit	Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!
John Hofius	DId I just watch a documentary about the inequality of wealth?

TannerTheManner	this was 250 million a few years ago
Thomas Peckoff	As long as I have a roof over my head and food in my belly I’m happy I don’t need that or desire it!
Imran Baig	Seeing a home like this makes me grateful for my health, middle class home and family.  I cant help but see this home and be reminded of all the people in the world who don't have a roof over their head and a simple meal. Life is to short to indulge in these purposeless vanities.
s s	I can bet you this wouldn't feel like 'home'
†æœs†	2:19 I can't believe you picked your nose so discreetly and wiped it on that gazillion dollar Louis Vuitton sculpture. You got balls my friend.  On a side note, if anyone ever wants to know what it looks like to be completely flabbergasted, this is the video to watch. Ryan is in such shock and awe, he can't say anything other than "crazy" and "insane" the entire tour. I would have just stayed quiet and not said a word. Because truly, you cannot describe this house in any other way other than to repeat words like crazy and synonyms of such a word. There is nothing more you can say. This is the absolute pinnacle of materialistic display. Anyone who can live in such opulence is an egoist beyond measure.
Bram Elyne	the dullest house I've ever seen. Has no soul
Jens Pettersson	But did you buy it?
Alan Fung	All we need is Tony Stark.

Ryan Byrd	Why are there twice as many bathrooms as bedrooms?
semiLivedj FICTION	If everyone could have one, We would be on to something. For the price you could feed a Country.
Mrs. JoBeth	It is nice, but I can't imagine it being a home.  It feels cold.  Even the pool area doesn't look comfy, relaxing, or fun.  It really is more of a gallery you can live in and not a home where you have some art displayed.
mattyjy2k	And yet so many people in the world drinking dirty water! The invisible hand has its middle finger sticking up.

Moe I	it annoys me how you keep going all ADD when the tour guide is trying to explain to you important bits about the house. it's like hes trying to explain to you why its so rare or expensive and your mind just wonders lol.
Ozored1	I mean wow, it's crazy, how insane are you to buy such a house ? Just bonkers.

Vagabond Feet	so boring
Amaru Wallace	Too sleek. I'm from the north east I'd rather create and build up a huge Victorian with deep wood and crushed subdued colors you know a home not an art piece. Also I'd hidden passages and rooms everywhere. But this shit nice though.
Pascal	i think i saw airwolf :)
daniello falzarano	I love this crazy and insane guy..
Matteo Vergari	If i had a dollar for every time he said "crazy" or "nuts"        I still couldn't afford this house

Victor Taguinod	I love Luxury Listings <3
Udip Adhikari	I don't know, it looks cold
Javier Jordan	OMG, that's no a house, it's a club.

Michael J.V.	who is house owner?
SkyPilot	Insane Crazy Nuts Wow Sure OK Bonkers

Roman Minárik	So stupid. Money are nothing, house is nothing, heli is nothing, cars are nothing.... What´s the right values in our lives? These stupid overpriced peaces of toys? Nah... Show me happenies and real understanding... Yeah, You cannot do that. That´s was I think.
Abhisht Shukla	Wtf!!! how many times I have to tell this bald man to stop letting people with a camera into my house. Plus that's not how i landed my helicopter last time!!!!!
Alex Augustine	The staircase worth more than my whole life...
Ibrahim mohammed	With that amount of money we can put an end to hunger around the world.
Scieta	Too much unnecessary stuff that drive up the value way more than the actual house. I could find a way cooler house (architectually) with 1/10 - 1/15 the price and use less than a million to decorate it properly = save at least 150 million. That is unless you care about portraying status through materials.
yo	i feel like 188 million isn't even enough for that if every item costs 40 million
Wabi-sabi8551	Classless vulgarity.

Glan	paul walker lookin ass
Voyager	For all the money this house and its interior is worth this is one ugly house. All that shiny metal makes it look cheap. And being 1 of 1 does not make an object art. To be art it needs at least some taste or meaning other than being the most expensive but ugly object.
Michael Lidster	It’s very sad, but no one will ever buy this house. The people who can afford it will not like the style. But hey, everyone makes mistakes
hpc Ghost	good luck maintaining the house.
Jack Kraszewski	You’ve got this house! then people starving and struggling to pay rent!
Tannichercules4	Why..
ASAP Sinclair	Fuck off no one needs that shit...of course if your get yourself rich with hard work you want to give yourself something back but not 21 Bathrooms 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️

The Nameless Nomads	Beyoncé I Am World Tour on the TV HAHAHAH
iRelax	Of course, it looks insane and absolutely amazing. But would you want to live in here? I wouldn't. It doesn't feel like a home. There is no such thing as "home" in this video. If I had the money I would spend it on a way smaller house but with alot of great stuff in it, not useless shit shown in this video. Anyways, sick house but nah ty :P
What's Trending	How does one have this much money wtf

Superdoop Productions	disgusting
Cloud Cata	Umm, yeah, sorry, but it doesn't feel like a home, not for me at least, it sort of gives me a strange feeling as if you have all the money in the world but nothing else apart from that. I guess money really isn't everything after all
TheHiqbal	Its funny how he remembers the price tag of every square inch part of the house, plus he is missing one thing being that rich & it is Hair on his head. Its smoother than a babies but. I guess he can’t afford hair transplant lol
C. C.	Why would you like to live in a HOTEL!!!
niilo22	take a shot everytime hi says  crazy, nuts or insane.  good luck!

Jhay 02	Lot's of money, but they don't knot how to help poor people?
RUNdone DIDit	"That's insane"....
Chapierton	'40 of your closest friends' ... 😂 40 of your closest wannabes and cling on's!   What a sad sad way to live. This guy presenting the house seems entirely shallow,   "This costs a stupid amount of money, as does this, and this too. That over there is so expensive no one can afford it. This is the only one in the world and its inspired by some other mentally rich saddo"  Everything is literally about money.   This fake lifestyle is definately not the lifestyle for me. I earn 50k a year and there's no way I'd swap that out to adopt this lonely way of life. I genuinely feel sad for people who own these places because they become targets and can never truly trust anyone, let alone their friendship.
Best Experiments	LOL
GateCrasher	How can so few have so much, and so many have so little
Pappy Dobis	they need to start making houses that look like houses, not department stores and art galleries.

Better Ad Results Are Possible	So..........Wicked Pizzas fits in to this where?

QuaussieMoto	I guess thats why so many people are so poor!

Zheng Lai	How many times are they going to drop the price tag and have people tour the house until somebody buys it?

atte kosonen	just imagine living there 1 week for free :)
diskuse diskuse	If you could afford this house then you'd also most probably spend less time in it because you'd be always working. A good place for a trophy wife I guess.
FartLord_69	The only things you say is 'wow, insane, sure, thats crazy,...'
Why is no one liking my comment	Why does it not have a grand piano and a soundproof recording studio with a drumkit, guitars, mic, etc. Even billionaires have time to play musical instruments.
luis Romero	Justo en la pobreza!! :'c

DeluxeBrian	188m is cheap
Sirius Ninkasi	That's great. Brag about your multi million dollar mansions when there's literally people out on the streets starving. Literally children starving while you live in your outrageous mansion with 50 rooms with one person living there. Fucking ass hats.
UnKnOwN GuY	Fuck the person that won the Mega Million yesterday can buy this house now if he wants smh I feel poor 😧

Mikes gaming	Insane
JustAMessenger	This is disgusting.  When I become a millionaire, I’m going to buy a small, comfortable home and then help everyone I can with the rest of my money.  Not spend it all on a pointless mansion.  I honestly cannot believe how some people are... It’s just so sad...

Neo Theone	Waste of Money..
Harman Enterprises	Jeff Bezos should buy it.  Although flash is not his type of thing.
Mac Diddles	I’d be cool with 3,000 sq ft house and a Supra. This is just absurd.
SSAM NINE	The people that could afford this (and not go broke along the way) give no shits about it.  I mean come on.  When you have hundreds of millions, does a metal staircase excite you?  We're all shitbag humans and it's all relative.  A helicopter to few is the same as a hibachi dinner to many
Dj Dose	Who owns this house??
Steady	Tacky
Phillip Moskalets	Why tho
IvanE _14	I got 50 V-Bucks     take it, or leave it..
ruru_ esco	This house is ugly asf... Idk why rich ppl do dumb shit with their MONEY...
Russell Jacoby	AMAZING!!I couldn't live there! Ok, maybe I could!!
Extreme WOLF	2M$ staircase ahaha get that shit outta here and take the sink with it like cmon.. The mansion itself without all of these useless things is worth like not even 70 Mill. I mean of course it's expensive for where it's situated but 188 Mill for it dosen't seems worth it at all to me.
Mike Bircher	This design and architectural style is really not impressive or aesthetically pleasing to me at all.  I'm sure it's beautiful to someone, but if I were a multi-billionaire in the market for a house this expensive, I'd immediately tear it down and have something beautiful erected in its place.
2 Beavers	say again "insane"
SuPeRMaRz	All this to be alone lmfao
Luke Christensen	Imagine throwing an all-out party in that house
bryan hachey	"thats crazy"
dabmotha	Everything should be seen as art  in this home, I'm not seeing 188 million dollars worth of art! Either you see just the art piece, or you become part of the art piece. None of that bullshit in between crap, it just laziness in my opinion. Not to be a shit but they show a beautiful piece then my eyes are drawn to shit on the side. @2:48 I mean come on what is that shit, I would have gone with a long oval table's and what's the highlight of the room? Because trust me it's getting fucked up because the focus off $188 million?  You should be drawn to the art pieces in the room not shitty..... Look If I want to look outside, I will look the damn window! SHIT redo people just don't know and I'm looking at this crap as a poor man in their terms...
Otiz Jr	I will turn that into a fucking hotel to get my money back
nibbzs15	1 word UGLY!!!!!! Wtf who wants to stare out the window after spending 188 million and the 1st thing you see is a giant cap of smog covering the city 😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Rich Gannon	Is it Fireproof?
SuicidelG	Only 30,000 people starved to death over the period of time when this was being shot. Not bad I'd say.
iAK47	Insane.Insane.Insane.Insane.CrazyInsane.Crazy.Crazy.Insane.Crazy.Crazy
Omar Lagunas	Theres people dying of starvation with out a house.....and this people building 2 million staircases...houndred thousand sink.....i just hope they could take all that to heaven......" For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God"...luke 18:25
ALifeTheKidd	If floy mayweather sells all of his Jewelry , he could buy this house...
al pal	You are the worst fucking host. "thats crazy" "insane" "bonkers". SHUT THE FUCK UP
Rogue Maltron	Imagine spending 180 million on a house and being the poor guy in the neighborhood 🤣.
Ugur Senturk	didnt even have a pool table every rich persons house has to have a pool table not impressed
Captain Sheep	honestly if i was buying a house in those price ranges i would want a bat cave installed
Nixon Rexzile	what a waste
Kermit of Rivia	For $188 million, i'd just buy an island. California is the last state anyone with that kind of cash would want to live in.
Tope Babafemi	The design is unique, not my taste but nice nevertheless. If I build an art school, it’ll prolly take 2 hints from here.
AGoodBuzz	Yeah, it's art, and it's cool, but just the big tubes of candy alone are throwing money in the trash.  No one will actually eat all that candy, and candy goes bad.  I love great architecture, but the video shows us very little of the functionality of the place.  How livable is it?  Or is it just a gallery of chrome and glass?  Doesn't look like a place anyone would want to call home.  It's just a big arcade.  More the kind of place some Saudi prince or Russian oligarch blows a wad on just to say he did, so he can throw a party or two, neglect the place, and eventually sell it off and make a profit because there is always another Saudi prince or Russian oligarch ready to blow even more money just to say he did.  Whatever happened to the great architecture of Hollywood and Beverly?  When stars and movie moguls built showplaces meant to be homes they actually lived in?
Khalil CHOUAYEKH	Craz11
Pietro Maira	i made a drinking game. EVery time he says Insane or Thats crazy ! im now completely smashed!
李越	I would have bought this if I won the 1.6 billion mega millions last night
logant44	airwolf does it again. finds a new hiding spot in a place no one will ever buy! genius
itzJKB	Should've had me there , would have seen some real reactions and enthusiasm
Fuzzyscarfandmittens	I'll say this, personally I hate Louis Vuitton. It's ugly and I've never seen the point of owning something they made. But that sculpture? It's exquisite.
379ToLife	Hands down the gaudiest most tasteless thing I have ever seen...
watchyamind	Must be nice ‼️
Fang Master	Is this house still for sale
trav v	What's crazy is if you hustle smart enough and hard enough you could afford that. Anyone could do it.
Adam Mada	That's just disgusting, I wouldn't even want it.
ozmo69	let me grab my check book real quick..
Marcus Frazier	Do they actually expect people to buy this?
Sly John	where is dan bilzarian and all the naked ladies??!
arsenalmanic	Sell all this useless crap and help the homless & animal charities.   Put it to a good cause.
Marc	It's on the market for $188M, you mean nobody wanted to buy it at $250M? :D
King Kyle	I own this house actually
Cl1nt	first question id ask him is why are you selling? what is this guys next move...
Dalsoo Plays	A man who would put out a fire with champagne doesn't deserve the house or the champagne, I don't care how much money he makes.
KingFameusa Gaming	Heyyy I built this in minecraft before.
Marion Frasier	how many fucking times is this guy going to say , WOW , CRAZY and INSANE. sounds like a scratch music CD
Haidara O	Are you sure that's a house and not the heaven ?
JayRay00	Fun to visit, horrible to live in. What a monstrosity. I don't want a giant camera in my living room, or champagne fire extinguishers. It's a mall not a home. When rich people don't know what to do with their money. Just buy million dollar art pieces and chuck them in a house.
Quagigitymire	capitalism works! for a few at least.
2nd Amend	Sad part it’s in Mexifornia home of the illegal alien and Democrats.
diego mardiaga	The place is awesome but doesnt look and feel like a home
Mr Baby	Us broke bois should unite and buy this house
Excel	Depression
Ahmad alexis	who is the guy
Greg Falco	Why not just buy a $10 million empty lot and spend $40 million to have a house this size built? Oh, wait, that's exactly what these guys did and now they're charging you 180 million.
Bernie Lomax	Now do a contrasting video on the streets of San Francisco.
oOF me	you have to be fucking tony stark to buy this shit or batman
Striffee	40 of your closest friends? Well, I have like, 3 friends. Maybe some Facebook friends could fill the other seats.
Thom Manalo	i would just donate the 188M dollars to homeless and buy them a cozy house for normal persons
Ilyas Daylight	World is not fair look at this house and some one own this shit but some people walking miles to just get a clean water to drink 1 month electric bill of this house will feat a village in Africa for a year sad just sad
ADVEXON TV	Looks nice!
Zenarchist	Lol Ryan looks like how I feel on the inside. A combination of horror at how much money has been spent on shit you'd never ordinarily care about, and also envy and the secret wish that you could afford to blow money on a place like that
Satish Stha	Used to be $250 million
AndrewPantshirt	no one should have that much money
Arcaryon Xavier	Honestly I think there is a point where a house stops being a place to live and becomes a prestigious object without any personal touch. Thats basically a palace. If you want to spend your money on that, fine with me but I think its a bit over the top. Just not necessary. Whom I to judge... ?Maybe one day.
Strmhartong Vomp	rip off !
Nicholas Nicholas	The pool 😲
Tylor Charoenpojana	CRRAZZZYYYYYY AND INNNSSAAANNNEEEEE
Marcos Rovira	this is the worlds fastest electric motorcycle in the world

Abrasivespoon 1	whats with all the stupid expensive quartz clutter looks stupid costs stupid to ad to a already stupid expensive house. i mean really if i had that kind of cash id want rid of that ugly ass lewis vuitonne rock thing out of that house
Kyle	Holyshit this house was for sale for $250M about a year ago 😂
Javon Alston	Even if i was a billionaire i couldn't spend 300k on a sink or 2 million on some stairs
A Day At A Time	Even if could afford to, I wouldn't pay that much for a house. I'm not that insecure and egotistical. I cringe at it to be honest
Leaveitto Kase	When I win the 1.6 billion mega million jackpot, this is the first thing I’m buying
TrafficScience	Maybe an expensive house but it could never be a home
LightUpTheSkyZ	who owns this house ?
Kwabena Antwi	I want to buy it,i want more info
Fragile	waow, thats crazy.
Gabe	If I hit that 1.6 billion lotto this week, I'm still not buying it.
aay j	It's an irony that hotel California is playing in the background 8:17
Dean Smith	As much as I was amazed at the magnitude and opulence of this house I was humbled when I realised that I would rather live in a caravan with my wife of 28years then live in this house on my own.........I might one day be able to afford a house like this but I could never buy what I have right now.......bless you all. :-)
Greg Norton	That's insane.
Baba Tunsdai	Wowe
Matthew Snart	“This is the world’s fastest electric motor cycle in the world”
isorenx	Crazy, crazy,crazy,insane,crazy,insane,crazy,awsome,crazy,insane,crazy
Homicidal	if i could afford that i much rather live in a house lol too big.
Chris L	Meh 😴
Davide	I don't know if anyone has already said it but that's crazy.
Stride309	Why do I have to be so broke
Zeko Reko	Amazing Channel, subbed.
Cody Estes	Crazy. Nice. Insane. That's pretty crazy. That's insane.
Lord Malice 45	That house is sick as hell!
Dawn Krevokuch	what’s the song name at 10:00
alex Calleros	Would not feel at home in that house.
The Crazy Bard	This isnt my kind of house honestly. I dont like the modern mansion look. And the doors are too big.
jaytroll	you cant buy taste.....but an insane pad nonetheless
Just-Ruddy	when you have more than you can actually use, you are only trying to impress others and you are not happy at all.
Jean-Michel Bourget	Looks like Zedd's house...
Daryck Brown	do they only play Beyonce in that bitch?
JUSTO MORO	*THAT'S CRAZY*
jony gmx	i wanna buy two of them
lima	doesent feel like a home...
SkunK Bud	Wait 0 to 120 mph in 3 seconds what!!!!
Ryan Logins	No, that is not the world's fastest electric motorcycle. The Lightning LS-218 currently holds that title. The Sora tops out at 120mph while the LS218 tops out at 218mp, or with the LS218 that holds the current record, a whopping (and theoretical) 278mph.
G J	wait wait wait isn't this the one that was $250 million.....
RamirezHD	At least it comes with the helicopter and the Buggati... not bad, not bad...lol
Carley Fudge	So the house itself without all the crap is worth about 15,000,000
Paul Denet	Why do people live like that when most of the world is poor and struggling? I can see if you're a great philanthropist and you help a lot of people but this is still an ultra extravagant status symbol that makes one wonder if perhaps you'd be seen in a smaller humbler mansion by those you help and everyone else.
M Aryku	And the property taxes yearly are how many millions?? And who will ever need something like that? I mean you pay $188 mil for the house then you pay few millions every year just on taxes.. hmm logic??
Su0T iN	Everytime he says crazy, switch it for ridiculous. That's accurate.
Omar Wacays	21 bathrooms for a 12 bedroom house? Doesn’t make sense!!
Charles Jones	Time to expand Ryan!
Abdul Hamza	Wait. Wheres the bedrooms????  And if I would of hit the mega million 1.6B I probably would of bought it lol
Andrew Cota	Looks lonely...
Harold's Thoughts	I love Luxury Listings
Friedland Research	What a total scam. This house is way over priced. Its super maxed out on every aspect, but it has hardly any room for the price-tag. Total Rip-Off
Daniel J	Impressive vocabulary
Spero Yunsi	Not a real home, a rich kids playhouse, Nothing cozy or comfortable about it. I would personally not want to raise a family in it, would probably be fun for a vacation tho, plus the art work is tasteless...
David Zheng	nine more restrooms than bedrooms? That's a party mansion! XD I wouldn't want anybody using my private restroom XD
Chubby Greyhound	Absolutely guaranteed that whomever buys this house for the rest of its life will be a massive pillock.
Bobby	Limitless money is no replacement for taste. In my opinion, the design of the house lacks imagination and feels both cold and lifeless. It's just full of things that were purchased for the sake of blowing a large amount of money rather than their look or function. Quoting the money spent is wowing people rather than the actual looks. I've seen really cool designs on "cheaper" houses for a couple million. I sure hope the owner gives a lot to charity.
Julian Marks	Rip Paul Allen
Joe Mama	Tacky
S B	what if the house went on fire ???????????? then stuck in credit
Alexander Caffey	And I'm struggling to buy tissue to wipe my ass
Darryl Burma	I love luxury listings! Holy crap that property is unreal!!
OuijaStreams	it's $188 million now? I could've sworn like a year or 2 ago it was $92 million. I could be wrong though
dljdljdljdljdlj	More adjectives please
Roger That	Insane...crazy...wow..awesome..etc etc etc....when you’re in awe...you tend to repeat things unknowingly.  A place we can only dream of when we are dreaming of a dream!
José Maldonado Rodríguez	If the "house" is for sale it means not even the owner could bear to live in there, right?
guy lamson	zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Peter Bird	03:47 LOLO What a joke. A stupid helicopter on the roof ? Only an idiot rapper, fat Saudi or slimy Jew would buy this garbage dump.
Daho_ Lifestyles	I want 22 bathrooms , so I’ll take a miss on this one .
Ereder	"the staircase cost 2millions, it's art"  ah no... It's not because you brushed and polished the steel that it's art and beautifull. For f sake the handrail is the exact same shit as what you get in any airport...
Stony Tark	"40 of your closest friends" who even has 40 friends
hde8	That's crazy and insane
Joseph Payne	This isn't a home it's a museum  The honey color art the camera, electric motorcycle and Champaign fire extinguishers are just a few impractical and useless things I seen.2 million on steps is stupid.this isn't a home it's a museum.what a waste of money.
O Dc	Whos bruce?
Filipe Vilar	Imagine how sad would it be to be alone in that house. Money isnt everything

Luke Lombardo	Boobs at 2:04 on tv
Guiro Joulfayan	This must be a pretty old video bcoz Dan Bilzerian has been living there for a while now, you can check his instagram account to be sure.
Daniel Santos	Wheres the gym? :D
kemolowlow	Only about 2.5 million a year in property taxes.
Johnny Goforth	Wonder how much it would be without all that expensive "art"
Shane Laughland	“crazy, that’s crazy, that’s crAZY, that’s insane, insane, inSAne, wow, nuts, nice, insanely awesome, What, Bonkers, oh crAYZy, OHh, What just happened, craziest thing”
Ravaug	How many times this house tour will be done of YouTube. There are millions of videos of this house tour.
Eric Bourque	188 Million dollar camera, can't afford a 4K camera *facepalm*
cdpgbc 1966	Disgusting waste of resources.  Some may call me envious, or jealous, but to be frank, I am not.  It is ostentatious.  Considering you can only be in one room at a time,  living in 38 thousand square feet is absurd.  As they say, some people have more money than brains.  Whomever buys it has likely worked very hard for his/her income and they can spend as they choose.  $188 million on a house seems like a very poor use of capital.
jeff ghant	Well, boats aren't for investment. They're for large egos.
Yung Swayze	Imagine being in a position in life to buy a house like this... My dream
Doc_R3STR3P0	I wonder what would be the monthly payment for all salaries, electricity etc.

Anthony Sparapani	Is it insane?
Geron1mo	Well, I know what house I’m buying if I win the lotto 😂
Connor Emburey	Mega millions winner has joined the chat
andrew lockerbie	The whole place is just an over sized trophy cabinet. Just a big penis extension.
Sky.46	And on the other hand some people are starving to death. Yep, we live in a really fucked up world.
mbPhase23	It is insane. The luxury is amazing but occasionally the taste is way off for me.
Appel1989	"you watch the superbowl with 40 of the "closest friends""... I highly doubt those are real friends when you have that amount of money XD
strongforu	This house has been on the market for several years now. I guess it will take a while to find that special buyer. I think that some of the art installations are beautiful and others are too over the top. I would imagine people that can spend that kind of money have already cultivated very specific tastes of their own.
Baby Whale Crypto	It's over-the-top stupidity.
Suave House	Not homie or comfy
abazdarhon	Nothing in this house make me say wow. Just overpriced piece of ugliness. Only one worth to see think is helicopter.
Haider irfani	Music at 00:10 sec anyone?
Hardcore Gamers	Dude looks so unintreasted
GoAdrian	I wonder if the person that won the jackpot of over a billion dollars would buy this house!

• Nix •	I love luxury listings
Isaac LeMasters	Skeeert!
Simo Pasanen	I think this is a good house for showing off. Why not. Everything is ultra expensive and shiny and over the top. Nothing wrong with showing off. And this kind of property would piss off many many people who you want to piss off.
UltraEdd	I've build my own furniture, so you could say it's design and you won't see anything like it anywhere in the world!
elchet	How much for the house with all the art taken out of it?
Hex	Odds are you won't make enough money in your entire life to so much as pay for those stairs.  Puts things in perspective.
Gary Duncan	That doctor Disrespect

Harry 28093	he is flexing on use he thinks he is cool
Tarek CH	Looks nothing like a place you can call home.
the links lizard	Still rather my 3bedroom semi d close to my local pub and bookies
alexxander	Amazing views, space and finishes but the furniture and the deco is over the top cheesy and kinda cold - and a lil too busy and intense. There is not really a true unique style to it. Just a glittery eclectic mess. For all that money, a missed opportunity really.
Enzo Tatsuro	think i'll buy this as my fifth vacation house  i do want a second helicopter to come with this house
Thats Not Gaming	1:13 Don't listen to this guy's bullshit. That's a really rookie way of thinking, a savvy businessman would tell you otherwise. Your house is not an asset, an asset is something that makes you income regularly. Your house does not make you any income, if anything it depreciates over time and also the property taxes on it yearly cost a pretty penny. While a boat for example can be used for many things such as travel, luxury vacation trips, events, etc, you can use it as a business to earn a lot of the money back for it and maybe even make a profit on it.
Cragnous	Shows all the stupid art that you'd get rid on day 1 but skips all the cool tech and server room...
DevonSlays Live	This is why this world is so trash. People that have so much wealth blow it on the dumbest shit. I know it paid a lot of peoples bills to build this thing but why in the fuck do you want a house that damn big unless you plan on letting your entire family tree stay there? 🤷‍♂️😂
Zepherian	Glass box full of overpriced shit. The only cool thing i saw was the Bugatti and the helicopter... Will be fun to see all those sweets go bad at more or less the same time... stupid house for stupid people who probably made stupid money a stupid way.
Ali Abda	His son will get gold diggers
Linoss	Fuck LV.
Kian Naicker	Uh who’s house is this?
Kolyashnikov	What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?
Revit Iligo	I don't like it, doesn't feel like a home, looks like a show room of tacky art
Vinny Aquino	this is not a home for me, 12 bedrooms? 21 bathrooms? nahhh. My advice to y'all. just live simple "inner peace" is most important
Royce	If i spend  $188 Million on a home....it will be smaller and I would own sooooo much land......
Cosvic	This house is unnecessarily expensive.
Troy H	what a bunch of useless shit!
earthwatcher2012	shot shitty and shit editing

God	Give you 50 bucks and my old ford for the lot?
Karan Shahi	I'm pretty sure the only things I would say to describe that house is "That's Crazy" and "Insane" as well. lol
aikenbcd	The house is great. It is just totally overpriced. It they sold it for let's say 30 million it would make sense to me. But 188 million Dollar? And I have seen this offered for 250 million. Who on earth would spend this much for a house. Even if somebody owns let's say 5 billion then probably most of it is invested in stocks of his company. Even with 5 billion you wouldn't give away that much money for a house. They would have to go down to say 30 million Dollars. That would seem reasonable to me. But 188 million for a house just makes no sense. Also why do they throw all kind of stuff in that you may not even want. Why a basement full of cars? I can buy cars myself. It seems like they took everything expensive they had left and threw it in the basement. It doesn't fit IMO.
sean mckee	This house is boring, pretentious and nauseating. Rich people who are flashy are boring. Buying stuff is an attempt to make them interesting, I guess that's the end goal.
Elemental Guns	This house is pointless besides showing off how much money you have.
Flavourcollinsis	Nice video...subscribe to my channel guys and watch social experiment videos from Germany 🇩🇪...and don’t forget to subscribe.

QT Fusion Dance	This house is too big. Very nice, I would love to visit, but I don’t think I could handle that large of a house. If I were a billionaire I would not buy this. I guess for a large family it would be okay, but otherwise nah.
Lucas Nix	Crazy, insane.
Ramli Rolos	13
Claire Cadoux	unwelcoming. uncosy. unhomelike.  After a few 'ooohs'  and 'aaahs' there is nothing but a long list of 'this one cost....'; 'best home movie theatre in the world'; the biggest... the best...it took 29 men 2 years to build...  it's not the 8th wonder of the world it's a collection of status symbols. Worse, they admire it. So ooo sad

Horizon X	These videos make me feel so shitty about my self
din Mac	You need to put things into the right perspective. All that for, let's say, just five people (an average big family)?! You really need that much for living joyfully?! That is the size of your ego

jesus jones	Give you £1o for it.
Khadija Newell	I'd have to renovate.
rod luva	kinda wack
Tony Mondola	I would be exhausted just giving people the tour of my house... Throw parties to try to make use of the space but things would just go missing not to mention paying for the upkeep. Electric bill $5,000/month when I'm not even there would be bullsh*t.  In Texas this same house would probably only be $90M.
Thegreat 1	I'd be suprised if this sold for 100 million.
Michael Watson	I love Luxury Listings

Luis Lopez	Oh yeah. Well I built a two story tree house where I will shoot bow and arrows off of it with my two sons
Arnau Floristán Ibáñez	You haven't convinced me
Micke	$188mil is insane. not that our currency here gets you billions for like 1000dollars. here 188mil is 1.6 billion dollars(SEK).
Peter Sims	I've never liked form over function.
Avram Ruben	$2 millions would save my life, I got 80 dollars left until pay day, my lifestyle is horrible and boring.
Stu Dunn	Clearly no one explained the other economics of owning property to this salesmen besides the flat purchase and sale value...  No residential property will net you a better investment than stocks after taxes, closing fees on both ends, repairs, insurance.
Yan's Adventures	They dropped the price, aww
TRUTH HURTS!	Just wanted to say that is a very wealthy man it is always entertaining amusing and predictable to witness broke and destitute people flounder around trying to create a disparaging comment about the accessories of wealthy people. Even when you try to mask or hide it your jealousy shines through all of your feigned indifference.
poseidon Zeus	Fun Fact: This mansion has been on the market for sooooo long and the price went from 250 million dollars to 188 million dollars. That sounds​ like a really bad investment.
Saïd Nike la police	That’s insane.
Nabi Bonyadi	Tjere is people in world who dont have any food and see this guy wtf 🖕 him and his house
sSsVincere	There is a lot of unnecessary stuff like yeah they are expensive things inside the house but whats the point? There is a lot of ugly stuff i would just get rid of lol . its supposed to be a house not a museum plus if you are that rich how many days are you gonna spend in the house? Ill probably be wandering around the world staying in different places not stationary in a house. Lol
Susath Rathnayake	Bruce Wayne right?

LiquidHigger	Who is this "Bruce" he keeps mentioning? Bruce Wayne? Bruce Campbell? Bruce Willis?
MindGem	I've seen this house in several different videos and the price tag differ between $500m to this, $188m. So you've got the cheapest version of this house.
O-H-I-O Go Buckeyes	Uh 12 bedrooms for a 188million dollar house? California be on some bullshit.
Daniel Walter	First vid I’ve watched of yours and I was gonna troll u about saying CRAZY,   U beat me to it!
MultiTwatman	Truly revolting
pratham J	A year ago it was listed at 250 million $ and now the same house at 188 million $... I think ill wait a fee more years XD
The Drobitussin	Paul Allen is dead
Sydney Robinson	I'm not trying to sound arrogant but my small house is better than this.  My house actually feels like a home instead of a mall
Uniform13	Where's the humidor?
Sinclair Jones	This house increase the cost of real estate in that area.  This house is 100 times over the top.  The number of people you have to hire to take care of it and guard it.  Just keeping it clean is a huge undertaking.  This house was 250 million dollars initially and since it has not sold the price has dropped 62 million dollars.  That is a huge difference.  It is not a house to live in but it is for show.
Mike Garrison	Bruce Wayne?
Vasily C.	meanwhile in 1%
Jon Hunter	No basketball court? I’ll pass
htown27bbc	Im tripping on the 40 friends stuff. Nobody has 40 real friends. And that big ass 📷 has to go.

Gurmender Grewal	Nice video Ryan. You never got back to me about the US $2.17b commercial business towers I'm helping sell in Australia?? I need a cashed up U.S. investor.
Alive	Last year this house  was  250M  now  188M  I'm  waiting till it comes down to 800$  thats how much i have in my bank account.
Fabio Aneto	Come in Tuscany, I’ll find you a Xth Century castle with secret garden, a medieval hamlet, surrounded by fortified walls and paintings from the Xth to the XVIIth Century. For a 10th of the 188 million dollars of this house.  God, this house is so horrible and the “art” in it is horrible. Tasteless. Just a waste of money perfect for an enriched person that doesn’t even know what beauty is.
OffGridHawaii	So what, who cares? We live on three acres for under 50k. We have over 100 frees trees, how many fruit tree does this place have?
Brodric Johnson	The muthafucka who won 1.6B last night in South Carolina could buy this crib no problem!

GenuineMtech	Bruce who?...Wayne?  Does it come with an army of midget butlers, a squad of eunuchs and a harem of exotic whores, inclusive of but not limited to 69 virgins (so no one accuses me of terrorism)?
Maknaar Fauzy	Thats not his house tho
sniper 97	Wooow what a mansion😄
ventende	It's not that smart of an investment if you look at it. Mega houses in this super expensive class has an extremely narrow market. Not many potential buyers, and the once that DO have the cash to splash would rather build something themselves instead of downgrading themselves by purchasing second hand. Buying this house from another alpha male makes them feel lesser than they should feel spending THIS crazy amount of money. Houses like this one stays unsold for ages and in the meantime it needs maintenance. Many times they don't sell at all and the owner needs to make creative and fragmented deals with groups speculating in corporate renting and splitting up property to smaller units - but only to a substantial discount. I say the owner of this house has black money to hide and threw some of it into this ridiculous house.
Robin Ceuppens	But how is the wifi?
A. N. M. Sajedul Karim	I own it
Michael	I love luxury listings. It's amazing to see where creative people go with design when money is no object!
leon voulgaris	sooo I need to sell 188m$ worth of coke to get this one... I better start from today.

hodenbacke55555	Thats Crazy! Thats insane! Damn this dude is annoying
Hayden Taylor	Insane.
Majic	My general impressions of the video: as a host to have such a limited vocabulary is embarrassing.  Secondly the owner of the house is a loser. The injection needles and giant slabs of rock makes him look soulless
Nootka Nookta	Does it have water?
Houston Volleyball	Lol it doesn’t make sense mark cuban buys a yacht that loses value?   1.) Buying things isn’t really about the value, it’s about pleasure.   2.) let’s look at the logic.. This house was worth $250M years back, now it’s $188M? Can’t use depreciation sample without first doing your homework...   3.) $188M will give me more pleasure purchasing raw lands and generating 8 folds within 5 years though.. See that’s winning! And that’s more pleasurable.
Oscar Gold	I wouldn't pay more than 2 million for that crap. And would never live in less than 300 miles away from that area.Even if my last name was Saud.
letterpool	Not my thing
ivanclark1989	Waste of money in my opinion, the upkeep and cleaning and pointless items in that house, I could think of way better things to spend 188 mil on

lillskiten1337	I love the closet :D and im a guy. Also arent you supposed to have a wine cellar for wine. And not openly like that in the light and all?  Thats my biggest gripe about the house and i dont even drink wine.
John Wick	The house is unreal but do you really need all that?
Wacko Islas	Slap a bunch of art pieces and jack the price up..100 million
lurcharoni	the people in the entertainment biz (artists) this was designed for don't really have this kind of coin ... real wealthy people, well I can't imagine them wanting this sort of stuff. it's a museum of  useless things ... reminds me of that 50 cent house from last season ...
werkannderwird	A 300.000 $ wash basin. waht can you do with it - well, wash your hand...
Domz16	I went from watching a minimalist video to this.

Mathew Ellison	People this is NOT Jayz and Beys house.. They live close to this mansion but Bey and Jays mansion is bigger than this mansion and way more beautiful.
Ung Dunker	one day...
Ostkreutz Rox	More a place for a venue than a home. But if your bank account reaches into the billions, what purchase on earth could excite you? This, maybe. Those fire extinguishers are just funny though.
Graham Taylor	You need to find another word for insane or crazy. All you said
mathew broom	Meanwhile theres kids in africa wanting $15 a month so they can survive. This is whats wrong with the world. Instead of progressing as a species and helping those in need..we spend 188 mill on a damn house. Makes me sick. Wanna build some schools in poverty stricken countries and help fix their economy etc? Nah mate i wanna put in a 21st bathroom in my house and have a helicopter. Ffs
Steven Monreal	All that and they don't have a trampoline....
Phailox	Wasnt this house for sale for 250mil earlier? guess it isnt selling well (;
SharkBait309	Is’nt this Dan bilzerians House?
Mordrede100	I might only be indifferent, but doesn't it have a negative vibe? Like the whole house as explained, all parts pieces have their unique approaches, but everything centers around how ridiculously expensive it was. I know these mansions exist so rich ppl can show off, but I would not live this thing and call it home. It's only bigger and more expensive, but with little to non added value for me. (ofc a gym is cool, but so is the gym I have 20 meters from my flat)
Philip Dow	Extremely over price gosh I hate real state agents, They're ALL scammers

allgoode	What a giant waste of money
WenjayTew	why do u need data center for a house?
Commissar Gamza	Yeah, that's about what you would have to pay me to live in that shit hole of a state.
Abroham Lincoln	seems like a good deal, trade in your entire fortune for a 12br 21bathroom house in the middle of LA, and then get taxed to death on it. Maybe you can think of what you would've done with that money while you sit in traffic every day?
Anton Steeman	so overpriced.
lmwrt	C.....r.........a..........z...........y.

The Sasqxatch	How do people get this much money?
Death Rager	188 million dollar house and yet, people are starving and no one gives a fuck about them. how much of this money has blood on it? can guarantee you some people litterally died for it, and killed for it.
ilish music	Its a nice mansion home. However I wouldn't have spent so much $ on the staircase, onyx wall, and custom designs like the LV. I would have gone with another selection.
angery dogger	Way too expensive, I can just imagine the guy going "WHYS NO ONE BUYING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
hpso	a lot of the art, furniture and pieces in there was unnecessary

Steven Toms	I stopped at the £300,000 sink. Obscene waste of money.
Paul de Groot	This dude seems so uninterested. Hes not even looking at the real estate agent.
Nicky's Gelicious Gels Nicole Gibbons	This is the most ridiculous house I have seen its insane to pay that amount of money for a house. One would not be buying this house for any other reason but to show off, its sicking. Even if i had that kind of money, there is no ways i would buy a house like that. This is why there is so much poverty in this world. I would keep on thinking about how many people I could help with that kind of money.
Mohammad Minhas	this house was listed for 250 at first..now its 188..SNAPP
Rozeth Chhem	I’m just a normal citizen making $14.00 an hour and djs every weekend. You make me feel like my life is complete horse shit

Ian Masters	"That's crazy." "Insane." "Wow." "Bonkers."
Han Solo Mid	insane
Dino Ucb	In my opinion this is just for showing and not for real living, what the hell I would do with 12 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms? And all of that artwork? It's not a museum it's house. Too much of everything! If I have that kind of money I would never buy something like this, I can go to museum whenever I wan't I don't need it in my house
Anginson Villafuerte	Ok... But cancer can kill you anyways.

bruh chill	if u sell the house as a salesman and get to keep 2% from it. thats $3,760,000. enough to live the rest of your life.
Herr KartoffelKoph	Carbon footprint is measured in miles not feet.
Ade Austache	That's insane. Anyway, I'd buy a patch of land and build MY OWN dream house from scratch for 1/10th of the price of this house. Only an idiot would buy this house for $188 million.
Jaketus	richer than me in gta

Jodi Howell	I bet whoever won the lottery makes a purchase like this and becomes broke within 5-10 years 😭😐
João Bruno	I’m pretty sure that this Bruce hi’s talking about is Bruce Wayne.
Eldain ss	What a boring place. For that money... i would rather build my own place,  with laboratory, blacksmith, electronics lab..etc. and other actually fun stuff. And why have cars or motorcycles, that you do not use?????.
Arkay EnterprisesTM	I would like to buy the house, where can I see the offers? My client is very interested
the derek Fawcett	Never thought to mic the real estate agent?

abdul ahad	Wt happens when it rains.
Anthony Xyy	The dude owner seems to be a pretty common sense and level guy? Who is he ? I have the newer (better) projector just sayin not that means anything at all.
Mad Max	Nothing special
Aakif Humaid	But dose it have wifi
Gregory Osbourne	It doesn't look homey at all. It basically looks like a small mall or office space that was converted into a home with gaudy amenities and corny/douchey art pieces to give you that really forced "wow factor", and also to over-inflate a place that is definitely not worth even a quarter of that price. But that's California for you --  the unreasonable price of real estate is what happens when you let trump style capitalistic pigs unleash their greediest, dirtiest, easy cash grab that in turn makes inflation soar and hurts the 99%, AKA most Americans.
Bacnow	I'm buying this house...as soon as Bill Gates adopts me!
T. Jim	Insane. Love the attention to detail. Work of art. The developers on our condo couldn't even center the faucet-head with the tub.
branchyapple	Awesome house! I never want to live here lol, it would be scary as fuck and i would use only 1/10 of the house 😂. Unless im with friends afcourse that live with me
Azad Hussaini	No person on earth deserves to live like this. This is just stupid. While people die and starve we have people with houses worth 188.000.000$ dollars. Pathetic.
Abud Shirt	I want.

Eyes OnPies	House comes with serf......er mean servants.
Ryuukai	it's amazing how youtube works, first I get recommended a minimalist video, and then autoplay takes me to this. It's fascinating really how I don't really give a shit about either of these videos.
A. J.	*AND WE JUST WANT YOUTUBE PLAYIBG IN THE BACKGROUND*
Rajito GAMING	You gotta take a tour of Mukesh Ambani's 1 billion+ USD house. Its ANTILIA
Maze	“That’s crazy”
MRVAPIDER	Am I the only one who would rather have a cosy highlanders wooden cottage over THIS!?
MexeEBierGHA por2khoncha	Why so cheap
zoomer2480	I’m sure Dan Bilzerian is currently renting this house. I seen a video of one of his party’s on YouTube and it looked like this house.
Born Boy	I feel like this is the kind of house owned by Raymond Reddington but he barely even visits.

Name Is	You sure this isnt one of Bill Gates’s house?
victor slodri	Basically what they did is call all their friends who sell expensive shit and they put it all together in one house.... You can probably build this house for 1/10 of the asked price...
Alpha Machina	That house is disgusting. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the type of minimalist modern design. But excess, just for the sake of excess is disgusting. It's wasteful and useless. It's only there to impress less than the top 1% of the population. And the fire extinguishers? No.. Puhlease! I know it's just another way to show off how absurdly rich they are, but let the /help/ and the automated fire suppression system handle that. You wouldn't want to scar your soft, manicured hands. And to think that the top 1400 or so richest people in the US are complaining because they have to pay 80%+ of the taxes. Well, folks, you want to flaunt your ownership of everything and everyone around you, you gotta pay taxes on it. :D
FuranDuron	Take that communism.
rahorin	He is very wealthy but for how long?  Judging by his ridiculous spending I say not long.

Joseph Herman	You know whats more expensive than that house made out of metal etc....????          A house made out of caviar
Miro Väisänen	If
Marcus L	This house cannot cure my cancer
SKYBLUE 100	Its dicks like this that promote the circumstance that leads to the detachment from reality that this house,its contents,and the statement it makes. There is NO HOUSE,AND NO CONTENT OF THAT HOUSE, worth the amount  that they enjoy boasting about... they should both get cancer... Lets see how crazy,his $300,000 wash basin is then ! Wankers.

Wâynę Måttë	The price actually went down lol
fodolo craigo	'that's insane'
Eric Cooper	"watching the Superbowl with 40 of your closes friends".....if you can afford that house then you have no close friends....your spouse probably doesn't even truly like you. They like what you can do for them though.
ShaneyPo0	My only gripe would be that I have to walk so far to get to everything. xD
Draco Takaani	With 40 of your closest friend's......... I don't have so many.....
Daniel Climent	When money don’t buy taste....
Custom PaleoArt	Here's what i don't get about Mansions... Who tf needs 20+ bathrooms?!?
C Lopez	6:10 "If your client ends up buying this house...." Guy thinks the "smartly" dressed twat has a client. By 11:00 it has become obvious there is no client, guy is now just being profesional until the fake professional leaves.

michael ray	plot twist. 188 million is just the taxes on the house.
Corazon 9494	I'll take it, do you accept ebt.
Young Faces	Wasn’t this tyga’s place 🤔
Vannroth Moeun	He said only insane 😂😂
remi moses	Like a department store, not feeling it. Plus if I'm spending 188 mill i expect the bedroom door to shut properly.
Never Mind	I'm going to sell my Vintage 1980 Yugo just so I can buy this Mansion.......hey' Ryan do those folks accept EBT Card for payment on this Mansion I don't mind trowing a couple of unused Food Stamps on the side plus a 10 dollars worth of bus tokens to get me in for the bidding.......
John T S	don't like his taste
Mark Laflame	That house is not worth that much bro seriously 😒
Roy	I'm waiting until it hits 125,000... It's dropped in price from 250 million to 188 million in under a year so in three more years I should be living the life :)
WeeWee	$188,000,000  My net worth is the last number

Johnny Rocket	OK, Mark Cuban does NOT own a $350 million yacht. It's an impressive yacht, but it aint $350 mil. He's too smart to sink that much money into a depreciating asset. Ridiculous.
Matthew Tuffy	Me "does the fridge come with the house" Them "does the helicopter come with it"
bettanswe	A little to cheap for my taste.
Ben Pubg	.....
MOStafa AzizYAr	your such a donkey money
Alex Hoppenbrouwers	Insane, Awesome, Crazy
Itxel Fletes	The house is beautiful. Yet wouldn't pay 188mill if I had that money. U know how many dog pounds I can feed? How many children around the world starving? How many kids with cancer dying every day? I'd buy me a $5 to maybe $8mill mansion IF... I'd won a mega lotto jackpot probably though. TOO much house for a family of 5? Maybe 10 ppl at most? Waste of money for 1 mega mansion. Oh well peeps let's keep dreaming though while we see the tour on this mansion!
dabrazillionaire	This house has been on the LA market for awhile. Started of at $250k and now they want $188k. I highly doubt it that the price would remain the same or increase in 10 years from now.
Marwin Kadner	Id rather live in a cosy 2room appartment in big apple than stay in this mansion.
jersey4life31	If i pay 188 million dollars for a house, I'm going to assume I don't have to pay any other bill while i live there.
Kommandant Franz	Nice vid. I always see this one on Zillow since I have it filtered by most expensive properties first. Still would personally prefer one of those 10-20m properties on beachfront Malibu.
david S	WOW👁️👁️💎
Reece Hobbs	Hahah it’s hideous
Marco Mark Productions	Damn, I'm broke as fuck
Jose	Money runs your world not mine
mockinjay3rd	Why do media has to glorify the rich and beautiful... fuck models and billionaires.
Dale Ricks	Wow this was supposed to be my house after I won the lottery
Malcolm	“40 of your closest friends”.... ok then.......
nextari	Everything about that place is stupid.  And much of it tasteless.  I would honestly just walk away from it, who wants all that crap.  Ryan has an air of aloofness and lack of respect, but this is his first video I've watched.
Isle Naap	Only 188 Million? 😄
elwayer	You make a f***ing lv of quarz of a querter Milion dollars and people dying of hunger, i hope this house price will drop until the people who made this house lose a lot of money😤😤😤
Sold23rdParty	Assessed value is around 12.5 million. On the market for 5 years and still unable to find a sucker to pay the asking price. This is what is called a market setter, they get someone to pay the asking price to jack up the surrounding home values. This is the air that fills a housing bubble.
Chad Thundercock	How sad and empty of happiness. You couldn't pay me to live in this house.
dudeskidaddy	what’s insane is how sad this place is.  Pathetic lack of beauty and aesthetic.  Crazy tacky.  Why are 30 bathrooms a good thing?  You can get that at the mall!  Rooms full of just stuff.
kiffani W	Beyoncé and Jay z owns this house now.. she takes pictures all over it. On her Instagram
fading_starz	SO FINALLY THIS PIECE OF SHIT MANSION WAS NOT WOTH $250 MILLION SO THEY DROPPED IT DOWN TO $188 MILLION 😂🤣😂🤣
Grace Gonzales	I wanted to see bedrooms,  master suite,  kitchen...
Tristan Silver	I thought this was the open house from "I love you man" but it wasn't so I hate this
Julio Palacios	Look at that grass blade - INSANE.
David Galvan	I couldnt live in this place knowing people starve , there is no excuse for it either since we have technology to help us preclude such things, but we rather waste resources than partition them for selective technological applications that would help everyone on this planet. Lol what is money with no people to give it value , or no people to advance the technology we have. The redundancy is so obvious but people fail to see it when they are told they can't create their own things or we can't earn a living doing something that doesnt just waste resources
the fake dj	The only guy i know that can live in that home is bill gates
King Manta	Looks more like a mall than a house. Not very warm or inviting. Pass.
JARED MATIJEVICH	#starvingchildren
#1hero	Only in gta
Logan Hitch	"insane"
rdizzo1313	The view of the Smog tho....😂😂😂
K Pax	you meet somebody, you ask them hey where do you live?  924 Bel Air Rd. them: what about you? Me: *Silence* , (with a look like I just saw a ghost)
Shyam Sundar Prasad	Most of the things in this house is completely useless....even if you see it from decoration point of view its still useless
jayraj vora	Cool.. Bigger house
Good Time Charlies	the camera man is suppose to shut the fuck up and FILM dont want to hear you right next to the mic! also your far far far away from speechless! edit your voice out Please... Aside from you  Awesome Video
ant Mo	What a fucking waste of 💰
Edwin Morales	Dan bilzerian owns that house
maltezz	its nice and all, but its just not cozy as a home should be.
kaz	No one brought this for 250Million so now selling for 188.
nodamnusernames1	you need to step up your vocabulary. hearing "insane" and "thats crazy" after every statement he makes kinda bores the video down
Buddy Mavy	Dan Bilzerian’s pad.
videoviewer502	Nice Location... when i eventually make my money...this would definitely not be my style...its too full of trinkets
Philip Donaldson	If that staircase took 2 years to finish they were building slow as hell, i’m an engineering student and ten guys could build a staircase that size of regular material in under a week
symba	So many parents literally see their children die, because there is no food to feed them.  Some people go to these parents, they tell them that the reason of such tragedy is the total unbalance there is of wealth in this world.  They tell them that if they want to change things, they have to commit crimes against the elite...  Who wouldn't do it?
Rc ProHunter	This house is either for people who plan to sell it again with a better price or for ones that are stupidly impressed by how much cool and unique things they can own in one place...
Inf3rno1221	Hey! Get out my house!
emerson coelho	I just felt my self so poor now.
Joe Bouchard	So much useless stuff in that house, BMW! Big Money Waster!!!
Jas D	Alright, gonna buy this when I win the jackpot this week.
g4rr377	I don't feel like that house is good value for money. For my money's worth I would fully expect a fireman's pole to slide downstairs. And a water slide from the bedroom into the swimming pool. And at least one crazy golf course in the bathroom
R.D.	That’s CRAZY
Human Observer	You’d have to be retarded to buy this gaudy shit for this price. You could buy an island, set up a solar power plant, build a castle, get a helicopter, a yacht, even hire people to walk around your castle in full armor (because it would be dope), and still come in way under this price.  Of coarse that’s if your the type of human being that could spend money on unnecessary material items as children are dying in other parts of the world from lack of food and clean water.
Rich Moyer	Over priced. Help some kids with cancer instead.
Willy Pp	I prefer a farm away from the monkeys
Gabriel Castaneda	I already got all this... in GTA
Balaclava Bob	That's a house ...it's  not a home .
Benjamin Friis	what do you do when you  lose your keys in this house it would take a year to find

Zcythe	even my minecraft house isnt that big
OffCloudz	Don’t even need to watch the video to know this isn’t worth 188 million
T-Bag187	InSaNe tHaTS CrAzY
Rs150User	Wow. this house are so nice and beautiful. it's only takes this house is a riches man.. god bless you if you buy it. home sweety home.. :)
Adam Shiminski	My q tips are made from the rare Tibetan Yetis pubic hairs. Its a million dollars every time i clean my ears.  Its sad people have nothing better to do with their money while people are going hungry.
Meme bitch hoe	This house is bigger than two of my houses put together
Brody Howerton	If I won 188 million I would drive a stupid looking car and live in a different hotel everynight

John Wayne	Reminds me of a rainbow 6 map
Twisted Bliss	Imagine looking for your car keys...
Hugh Jackson	Insane... Crazy...
Christian Tirado	Sure your rich but it's not gonna be fun when it rains and you gotta move everything
Simple Frankie	Where is the indoor strip club
Russell Turaja	That word "crazy" annoys me. Tf
dana purcell	They must have dropped the price because it has been for sale quite a while and was listed for $250,000,000.00
xfbth4z	one person to have this much wealth and money is not logical. most likely they have undermined countless institutions and people in order to get where they are at. meanwhile..there's millions of good and innocent people starving to death everyday. the world needs a reset
Omaru -	The House cost 8 million dollar and it's furnitures like 180m 😂  I feel like Zedd 16 million dollar house is better .
Keyur Pandya	Shit cameraman. I cnat watch past 52 secs I am done.
Sk8Rat19100	Feels like useless junk to me I’d rather spend 188 mil on experiences, too each his own.
A Lone Pizza	Pshh, that's nothing. I think I could afford the...um...pillows?
Light23K	That's insane, Crazy, Bonkers.
Tech Bandit	yes.........cool........insane.........great........
Omar Shafi	When a bathroom sink is worth more then your college tuition... car....house.....soul

Sheree Morgan	Bruce Makowsky, also designs some fabulous hand bags.  I have purchased many of them.
DEATHSTROKE	the amount of useless boring shit in this house is insane lol..

Amayzinone	I would just like 1/1000th of the price of this house plz...
Colton	I Love Luxury Listings!
Eysten Martin	I love that Beyoncé is playing thru the whole house
BillMcGirr	Um... why????  Giant cameras... Ugly art.  Massive tax and upkeep.  Someone was overcompensating for their unfinancial short comings.  Good luck selling this money pit.🙄
Jason Chow	if i get a dollar everytime he said crazy, i would be a billionaire
Aristotle Kumpis	For $188M, you'd think a house would be warm and inviting. Not this one. It looks cold and boring. Sure, lots of cool things about it. But every room seems way too large. I'd rent it out for a killer party though.
Nazariah Gatal	It's too big. When it's too big, the house becomes creepy. Not to mention the echo reverberating around you when you speak.
GamingWithAiden - Roblox and More!	Hi
James Frame	Place is corney
YOU TUBE	This has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever seen. Makes Trump look like a minimalist.
M Tesfay	I living in 2 beds room sharing flats pay for one room £250 for month including bills.imagine that mansion how much cost the bills a month ohhh God bless my room
chain1989	No Gaming Room?? pffff fuck that
Mir Mohsin Abbas	It is more better than the 1 b $ house of ambani
Ayy_It’s_Danii	I love how the cameraman is touching everything expensive 💀💀 something I would do
Marcus Savina	Eh... I guess
TheTrueCanadian	I watched this for about 1 min and had to stop bc it was making me feel so insignificant lol
Razz mn	Health Is More Important Than Wealth!
ofaas	Imagine living here until it becomes mundane, that's gotta be incredibly depressing. This is the pinnacle of material wealth and you're bored of it. What else will satisfy you?
MyCrzyLife	Truly awesome house, but way too expensive for sitting on only 1.2 Acres. Billionaires want privacy. I would think if it was on at least 5 Acres, it would probably be sold already. But, then again, lots of extra costs that come with this. Like putting 30 Million Dollars worth of cars and motorcycles in your name, paying for the service, the maintenance, etc. Not to forget how much you would have to pay in taxes, closing costs, etc. In order to afford this and keep it, you would have to be one  rich A$$ person, that doesn't like privacy
TrippieTray	He said "crazy" about 20 times 😂
Chevyholic 18	Crazy!!
Conrad Diaz	I got 3 take it or Leave it
King Lam	Insane, crazy and amazing lol
keinan briggs	As you can see this window is worth 1.5 million...Wow, that's crazy,

moonlander03	if I was rich and could spend all that money on a house..  I would carve it into a mountain, most of it inside of it. ^^..   would be protected from mother nature ^^.. bulletproof glass every where...
Pewdiepie died from ligma	Im setting up a *kickstarter* to buy this mansion
RexBlade Plays	I currently have 34 dollars what kind of house can I get with his much

KillerHunter808	Not A Fan Of Mansion's But Do What You Need To Do To Satisfy Yourself
TacticalAdvantage	If your client needs a professional pilot to fly the helicopter and plane I am the man to do it.
Darkwolf787	Am I the only one who things this mansion is an ugly, horrendous monstrosity? If I were a multibillionaire and a realtor presented this mansion to me, I wouldn’t want to buy it. I’ll admit, there’s lots of nice features like the home theater and bowling alley, but I’m a person who leans towards traditional style mansions. For example, the Kardashians’ mansions.
Juan Arreola	Cheap😂
Georges M Grob	Totally tasteless. The house is like a strip mall. It lacks architecture which is good design by definition. No sense of composition. The accumulation of expensive materials is one thing but matching them correctly is another. It's like caviar on a paper plate and champagne in a styrofoam cup. You must have just arrive.
Luisa Ch.	Take a shot everyone he says “crazy” or “insane”
Rakesh Mairembam	only words this guys says is: "crazy", "sure" and "awesome"    ...hahhaha :P
rumich hg	When I win the lottery

Tyler Varni	Tbh I just want to know how good their internet is
yummy041496	I might be able to afford the cup of coffee in the bedroom... might
THEmickTHEgun	Lives in this house. Decides to go on a holiday. Packs bags and heads to the roof. "Ahhh it's nice to get away".
Dont Talk To Me	So you skipped over the good stuff like the room with the computers but you spend 5 min on a dumb ass camera. That camera was a million dollar paper weight.
Mimic Viruss	Is crazy how nuts this house is! Just insane!!!

Steven  Kane	Who owns this house
Mr. Nickolas John Krznarich	This is a very museum like home. Did I just say home? Estate rather. I agree with a few of the other people that left a comment for this video. It's not my cup of tea, yet, I would not mind one bit to live in it. I left a Supremely important comment with a video called a 2 Billion Dollar House. They should have said estate as well. My comment is absolute, please try to get a view of it. You Tube has it buried within an untold amount of comments from others and I believe you have to click 'newest comments first' or 'top comments', but, they even have that choice button hidden in some kind of cloak or something, but, believe me it's worth a few extra seconds to get to my comment.
skyscreemz	No ultra rich person is gonna buy that property in LA for that much.  They would rather spend it on a Mega Yacht where they can take their property cruising around the World!!!!!
Winston B	That isn't a house. Its a trophy.  So much for cozy surroundings. They'll probably just end up renting it by the night to party promoters or some Saudi prince will buy it and never set foot in the place.
Basil43D	The closet is like the same square footage as my entire house...
Chaschuky999	I’m gonna live somewhere like that someday. Some way some how.

FFL j	Thats Crazy
don brink	I could design a better house with a $20m donation and fill it with ZERO ART.  And worth it at $120m.  no name tags no name drops. location location.  prestige is a concept of small minded tiny dicked men.  and as someone pointed out earlier. 2 years and 2m to build a staircase? Nah.  thats just abusing a wallet because the people who built it know who its already being built for.  boats.. ahh good old boats.. there is the age old saying that there are two things you dont buy... a boat and a horse....  boats devalue so quickly and truthfully because of the wear and tear of constant forces against it. a good boat isnt mass produced. its hand crafted top to bottom. one of a kind. made specifically.. this type of boat is not like that shit story of a staircase..  you build a boat top to bottom with your heart. you take care of it. it will last decades. without the constant problems of mainstream creations. there is nothing wrong with being filthy rich.. but even the rich could save money and have greater value if they remember to be humble and buy the true worth of an item.. true wealth of an item is craftsmanship. not a name.

wEtClOuT	Can we get an insane and crazy counter?
blaise rascoe	That would be cool and all, but it seems too much like a museum. I don't want to live in a museum.
allwaysgrowing VLOGS	WOW!!  That's a HUUUGE price drop from it's original asking-price of $250M just about a year ago.  Does it still come with all of the art and the estimated $30M car collection??  I was hooked on this house when I saw some video of it's construction and the intended plans when Hilton & Hyland first listed it.  I'll admit, the finished residence is absolutely breathtaking!!
noreworks	I've seen this house reviewed several times over the years. guess it's still for sale, eh

mrdwaji	That’s crazy!
ben taka	how many times this guy gonna say sure?
Remi Stardust	It's funny, you could put that music over a video with a tiny cozy house, showing two friends enjoying a cup of tea. The music is trying real hard to sell this hedonistic, bad idea of a house instead. This house doesn't work. If you can afford this AND buy it, you're trying to fill a hole and are great at suppressing guilt. The resources (money, human time/skill and materials) that went into building this teenager's idea of joy/success, could have saved actual human lives instead. Or if you're a misanthrope, you could rescue thousands of dogs from shelters, or buy up rainforest to preserve, or clean up the ocean, etc., etc.
Christopher Robson	Who's house is this? Went back thru the video and I heard Bruce but not the last name. This can't be Bruce Jenner's house?

jrscovill	At the wealth you'd need to afford this it doesn't even matter anymore what the pricetag is. All that matters is that it's unique.

insektmute	I feel like if you own a house like this, you're probably an asshole, and so is the guy showing it. You could probably feed and house the entire homeless population in LA for a year for a fraction of what this gaudy tribute to excessive consumption costs. What a waste.
Joshua McCandless	What kind of moron real estate agent tries to sell a house like this by saying it is a good investment lol?  You think Mark Cuban gives two Shi** about how much his house is worth?

Maurice Davis	Advertising for mega millions winner
PsychicToaster	The wealthy are least creative people I've ever seen. This house is ugly as sin, a true affront to architectural aesthetics. Good christ. Only the most banal, morally bankrupt shithead would live in a place like this.

HoodNaruto	My house if I win the 1.6 billion lottery
drk gang	Insane
TacticalSocks	$188M is California pricing.  Building and tricking out a house, with $188M, in a state that doesn't have JACKED UP prices. . . . .one could more than likely have something much bigger and nicer.
Pølle Dølle	meanwhile people living in tents less than 2 miles from there ! Humanity <3 and who the fuck wants leather in their drawers :D
Masiosare II	Basically they're selling a 10 millions house with a premium of 178 millions for a superficial an bad taste "art collection", only a new rich or hip hop star are the targets

Roddy Dykes	*Sure*
Mrmusikman 82	got annoying for how many times he said the word "crazy, and insane"
A.J. Ello	If I were a billionaire, I'd put a shotgun in my mouth before allowing myself to live like this. Absolute disconnect from what matters in life (to me).
M.	It's a house...not a home. I could never feel comfortable owning a $188,000,000 house looking at rich people's shit ("art") I could do a million..or 1.5...but that is just CRAZY!

ReachAroundStudios	Hasn't this thing been on the market for a few years now? I seem to remember the price was higher at one point as well, and the guy giving the tour gave the same speech to a news channel. Sounds like he is getting desperate for a buyer. Let me know when it gets less gaudy and i'll check my wallet.
Dennis Ford	Thats crazy, crazy, crazy, bonkers.
KRONK	Gross.
Mountain Mike	If I win the 1.6b lottery.  This house 3 kilos cocaine 4 pounds of weed Domino's
kingofschnitzels	Tackiest house I've ever seen. This looks like what you'd get if you had an extremely poor person describe an expensive mansion. Pretentious artwork, LV everything, the whole place is too shiny and uninviting. Half the "art" is literally a polished slab of rock for fucks sake.
Hidde	This is fucked up dumb do people trow their money at this shit?
Danny Valentino	Must be nice to be rich
Winters	I would knock that monstrosity down, sell the "artwork", then build something actually nice.
Bit Coin	If I had 188 million dollars to spend on a house, I would add 1 billion dollars to make it submersible. #submersibleyacht
Venusius	It's not a mega mansion. It's a $188 million museum on gross consumerism and material excess. The owner is selling this property probably because like everything material, it fades away. The house is cold AF, it has no warmth at all - it is not a home but a storage for things.
Aarsh Saini	That bathroom cost more than my house wtf
the wock	2:42 probably the sex room

SheFlungDung	Who's home is this? Bruce who?
Tippers Dad	Plastic living.
King Prospect	So that is what you do when you have so much money you have not a clue what to do with it. I guess this....
Gazz Robinson	Anyone else watching this while holding there Mega millions lottery ticket which draws tonight and is at 1.6 BILLION? i still wouldn't buy this house lol
The Noob At Everything	I would not want to live in a house that big, I mean you could harbor all the middle eastern refugees in this house!

Darren Abdul	That’s crazy, wow, amazing...wait...that’s crazy Insane
Erin Manley	That smog at 3:09 though
Jobu_Cerrano	This just is not impressive.  Architecturally unappealing, the design is hideous, just terrible.  This guy is supposed to be a designer?  It looked like someone puked up the 70's all over this place.  Ugh.  No thank you!
Deonte P	This house sold for 200k though...
BusyBINTHEhous3	If something like this is so expensive. That much money could bring so much people oppurtunties. Like scholarship or aid. U could help so much others but people value an expensive million dollar car or super expensive stuff more than others wellness.
6ix Head	But this house was for 250 million at first.IDK why the lowerd the price.
txhypnotist	Thanks for the tour.
Dctiger_24	What's the song at 10:05

silver	But is it safe against the purge
Leroy Westdorp	Mom get me your creditcard!
csabee kov	I’ll give you 160
Corvettes and Coffee	I’m not sure how much this guy in the beginning knows. But I’m in superyacht sales and he’s so misinformed on that aspect alone. Marc Cuban doesn’t own a yacht.  The yacht everyone thinks that he owns which is owned by the sears ceo certainly isn’t worth 350 million either.  And lastly I’ve never heard of a 350mm yacht on the market for 50 million in just ten years time.  This guy could sell a beach house in Ohio.  Anyways, huge fan of Ryan. 😂💯
Aldair Vega	EVEN IF I WIN THE LOTTERY I WILL NEVEER BUY IT .. WHO NEEDS SUCH A BIG HEADACHE ...LOL

Drew L	Tour of a $188M house using $12 media equipment.
Jacob Johnson	why was ryan even in this video, the guy giving the our was interesting, all ryan had to say was 'thats crazy' or 'insane'
striklylow	It saddens me to think that 1 person could have it all. On the other hand some not so much. To me becoming wealthy will just never happen. Sure you can work hard all this and that. But it will just never happen And to everyone who says. Never say never. C'mon be real ffs it just won't. It's all luck. I mean imagine if you were born into a wealthy family. You're basically sussed for life.
quiltedquickerpicker	The amount of upkeep cost must be insane as well.
El Guapo	Wow if an Earthquake Hits and destroys It you could still sell the scrap and be Rich!!

Justin Davis	Don't even wanna know how much it costs to license Kasabian...
Luca Viggiani	“This house is so expensive, it has its own lunatic asylum” “Insane!”  It’s vulgar, tacky and it’s what happens when people who have no idea what the power of money is, need to wear it , bathe in it, put fires out with it and shit in it. It’s nothing more than a showcase of vulgarity and doesn’t look or feel like a home.  There are much better homes on Zillow in LA that I would much rather have and you could probably buy ten of them for 180,000,000.
GiraffelHD	Welllll.... a staircase takes 2 years to build

belleon_xanioo	So who is Bruce 🤔🤔🤔
sifumaster	This is not a house, this is a museum with bedrooms and a pool. All the art installations and expensive materials just drive up the price but won't increase your comfortness or quality of life.
Xtermin8r187 B	The taxes he pays on this and HOA fees  house could feed a small country
Tyler Something	Meh
KING SO's SHOOTA #IWILLSLAPCASHNASTY	Franklins house

a d a s i s k o	SUBBING TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES AND SUBS🔥 comment when finished 👇
ERRORFACE1	click to see boringboringboringboring back to far cry
roB9099	Unreal mansion. Lacks the comfort and coziness of a regular house though.
Harry 8642	I'd rather but a whole mountain side and build a nice big log house. Love the outdoors because of the freedom, this house it just too big and its in a shitty city.
Nicole_Naiya	Does the house come with the Beyonce music and DVD? I'll take it
Zayn YourSoulmate	-Im going to my grandma's house -Thats crazy!
skatxn	How does one make so much? Sell your soul?
Brydonisgod Wright	What a shame they let that gormless twit have a look through the house.
Curlyboy23	When u do a money glitch in gta
NickName Mn	overall its boring.. too much crap in it
torrace12	"That is crazy"- is the studder of a man reaching hes social behavior ceiling - i think because hes Swedish (Henrik) it gets extra hard since Sweden is the most materialistic country in the world
Simone Eli	This house was going for 250 million two years ago it will drop again no one is buying it at this price either
Snapparazzi	188 million imagine how many homeless people you can save with that. What a world.
Alex Coates	If I win today I’m buying this mf
Jordan Johnson	Dan Bilzerian's crib
Mackenzie Patrick	Is it just me or does this look like the place that Acon trampolines took their photo shoot wierd question but I just thought it looked similar? No one will probably know what I'm talking about but still.
Schell 01	So we've discovered that you think this monstrosity of a house is "crazy, insane and awesome"?  Personally I'd describe it as fucking horrible. It's like a really chintzy exhibition of pointless and ridiculously expensive shite. I've seen more tastefully decorated Gypsy caravans.
Daniel Masterson	I would buy it then burn it to the ground.
Jean Sebille	Who is bruce?
None None	I love the interior of modern homes but I think the exterior is kinda ugly. So even if I had enough money I wouldn’t purchase this house
David Vargas	aint this tyga crib
Random Personal	Its a very cool house  But I would feel like the most ostentatious douche having friends over
FlibMyWib	but whats the point of a huge house
Ashley Nongkynrih	i didnt take the FYI
Nice Shot	It's mine after I win tonight's Mega Millions. What? I still will have 200 million left after the purchase.
furiousgtz	Watch some mega-million loto guy buys this and goes broke instantly because he has zero clues on how to manage money.
Aelad99	this is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
Down Syndrome Danny	Can’t wait to buy one with the multiple millions of dollars in my back pocket.
Ian Easthall	What's the second song? Around 10 mins in?

Panos Alamanos	This mansion is a million times bigger and better than my minecraft mansion lol.
Nikorasu Oxendine	Lame.. I've seen better homes on the Netflix series "The World's Most Extraordinary Homes" Even if I had 188 Million dollars I wouldn't spend it on a simple, boring, and bland looking mansion. I would hire a architect and create a work of art to live in.  Really now, that looks more like a Business than a home. I would hate to stay in it.
Sherm Perry	I had a house Like that on my list, The back door too......Now I'm in jail. Joke.LOL
Razzola P	Geez Ryan you have gone grey last time I saw you on tv your had colour
altbeb	and you know why they are moving,, it is the god awful music coming from next door at ear splitting level...and with all the money they spent on the house, they were too scared to actual take a shit in the powder room, or actual sleep int he beds...and 3% of 188 million is 5.4 million.. and it is all about the money...
Constantine Hadjipateras	Bruce Makowsky?
Johnny Superbman	jesus christ, it's insane what money does to people. The vast majority of viewers right now can't even dream about having this kind of wealth and we all say "oh this is so stupid why would you need this much stuff" simply because it's something we can't even comprehend owning it. I know for a fact that if I had this much money, even if right now I say it's ridiculous and that I would never buy this much stuff, I probably would simply because it's there and I can.
Defy	Yup, that's where Dan Bilzerian currently stays at...
Archive jpg	This is dan blizarians house
Sam E	Imagine the comission on this bad boy
cristian9955ify	How much for taxes on it tho? Lol must be nice

krazy Azii	House:$15 million   Other useless and un needed stuff: $171 million   The house is cheaper is just the other stuff such as cars and arts and other weird stuff that costs the most. $80000 for an anchor, like why the f would u want that. Helicopter is cool but u can’t use it unless u have license and I am pretty sure ur not allowed to just fly away anytime u want
aakhil sheriff	With luxury comes great responsibility
john smitty	it seems too personalized with all the art, i doubt many billionaires will want to spend that much money on a house that is already fully designed to somebody elses preferences... also more then half the value is the art pieces, i think its much more likely rich people would want to build their own place or buy a empty one then pick art and design that actually suits them
Daniel Rus	I just want to add one thing, that´s crazy!
Philipe Jose	No one NEEDS this lol. Completely unnecessary. Just a prick waving contest.

Tiger14n DH	When a bathroom worth more than your house
Asaad Ghafoor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdJdG5cpYw  I thought that was 250 million so Dan Belzerian rented it for a couple of days?
Kane Holmes	*The mansion originally went on sale for $250million years ago.* The owner was targeting the 0.1%... The Ultra Rich  However... The only thing that makes this house valuable is its location. Land space is more valuable than the property that sits upon it. The problem with this mansion is that most of the land is built on, which in turn massively de-values the property.  Anyone within the owners target audience isn't stupid enough to purchase such an expensive property especially when it only has an estimated value of $60million (leaked documents of the builds total cost was $57million). The fact the mansion has been on sale for several years and still hasn't been sold should tell you everything you need to know.  Oh, that guy at the start talking about people that own mega yachts but rarely use them and that they depreciate over time. The people that buy these yachts aren't buying it as an investment like most things in their lives, their buying them to enjoy.  Last time I checked, a mega yacht was a clear sign of the ultra wealthy status, not some extortionately overpriced house with a helicopter you can't use.
Khaled Alarabiyat	It looks like my mades house
Zen	This is amazing 😨😶😌
Always Learning	You're the worst YouTuber.
Random Dude	I hope they drop a bomb on that house
MaxximumAJ	Last year I watched this video and it was 250M now it’s 188M and they still can’t sell. Just wait... just wait. This guy made the worst investment of his life

BouncingPenguin	I dont know how to chill in this house.
jamesb8488	The house was meh... For $188 mil? I'd never buy it. Like another said, I would rather design my own for that price.
marlin ewing	Id like to put an offer on the house?

Robbie CatMan TV	I don’t want fame just lend me a few million...
Mr Music	There is a difference between tasteless and tasteful luxury.
Jackie Herrera	With that amount of money you could feed all the hungry people of the world. It is disgusting how the rich live when there are people dieing of hunger.
aman kumar	What a waste. When rich people don't know what to do with all their money. 188 mil could haven been used for for so many good purposes.
Trey Bells	admire the salesman skills but a house aint an assert its a liability
x Blazyy	Insane.
Hunter Brown	My thought through the whole thing was “that’s an odd flex but okay.”
Scott Blake	Have all the money in the world your shit stinks just like mine and your grave will be just as deep! Fuck money
Abdusselam Alan	not worth at all .... thanks for the tour btw ..
deity 93	I dont understand the need for this? this isnt a home, this is a primal ape like expression of sexual dominance. These people are like bipedal magpies.
Myself X2	I love real estate but when I see the obnoxious amount of money wasted on esthetiques and glamour it makes me sad knowing how it could have been used for much better use in the world...Legally they are free to do whatever they want with their money. Ethically it is wrong and just sickening.
T Mura	It was listed originally for 250mill , now it's 188mill? Hahaha people that rich don't want to live in an art museum. That builder must've swallowed a bullet on that one.
cassetoi09	who is this Bruce character?

pure tm7	Bill Gates home is better..
Sound Therapy	i think i just heard a starving kid's stomach growl
Plunder crest	Showed everything except a bedroom, the main part of the house.
Hero Jason	I like the design of this house but honestly you can build it under 10M if you really want this house be next door just buy huge land cost around 2-5M this house brand new will cost around 30M max. Giving the tag of 188M is ridiculous. If you are smart rich man you will not buy this house.
Night's Freak	and people in africa cant get something to eat
Jon King	You'd think they'd find someone to commentate with a larger vocabulary than "crazy" and "insane"

MR.LATRSH-JR Latrsh pro	Its expensive but should it really worth THAT MUCH JESUS!!!
Little Problem	how many friends would you have living with you in here ?
Mcjuts 420	I bet vinny chase would buy it.
Ralph Italian	Wow, I’ve done something wrong in my life. This is beyond incredible!!
Jesus	Post Malone tweeted "Money doesn't buy happiness, but financial freedom has a priceless view". Idk if any of you saw the tweet from a while ago but he is right. Imagine having hundreds of millions of dollars... what worries can you possibly have? People who are rich eat the best, sleep the best, travel the best, etc. Trust me, more people should put wealth as one of their goals. I can assure you its worth it.
ManOfProgress	I would like to go in with a baseballbat and smash everything
Jay Philip Williams	Watch a movie with forty of my closest friends? I hardly know forty people!
Fresco D.	Think of all the good that could have come from buying a 10 million dollar mansion and donating the rest to charities.
Nord Dank	This house is amazing. But it's also a house, for very few people. Most billionares wouldn't buy this.  This is a house for a brand new billionare, who is yet to invest in art etc.
Robert Mindolovich	“Crazy. Insane”
Isaiah Smith	Does it come with better air quality. The smog is next level
pej f	Bruce... as in jenner? lol. or bruce batman?
seesharper	Even if I had unlimited money this mansion would be a waste of money to me. I'd buy me nice self-sufficient cabin and land that is far away from other humans, and live my life. I'm getting depressed just looking at this house. Too much flashy shit that serves little to no purpose.
Mark Jacob	A tornado an earthquake ... And boom 188M dollars gone ;)
Edward Kenway	Guys that's my uncle 😁
Irwan Zainal	This home was listed $250 million not long ago when it first revealed but now $188 million not a good investment......
Future Tv	Take a shot every time he says "Crazy"
Bullion Forever	I think the issue is all the expensive extras in the mansion the few people who can afford this don't want, it's the mansion and location that brings value, not a bunch of cars and custom pieces that were built to send the price to an overvalued territory.
danny b	Airwolf
Fotomo	A nice dogs hut besides my $188 bazillion house
Joshua Lanier	Couldn’t watch the whole video with the volume up. “Insane” and “crazy” seem to be the only words in this guys vocabulary. Completely clueless...I’m glad it’s an impressive property because he couldn’t sell his way out of a wet paper bag.
Kurtis Gomske	Seems like 188 million dollars would be wasted on something so impractical.
EliteCanadian	Can i have this house for free?
Sensei Dekkers	bo2 raid map
Marcos Alencar	He say´s "that piece worth XX thousands dollar...." but I bet if anyone try to sell those things, will never get those prices.. who would ever want 100kg piece of rock in a bag shape?! or a oversized camera?!
Benjamin Larsson	*Everything is best in the world*
Hoddinott Vids	Its so big where would you spend most of your time bowling alley swimming pool dam I would be happy to have a baby pool and a movie theatre do you know what would be great a full sized hockey rink I’m shaking just thinking that would be in my house
torodaman	I say....48 times
OhTea	this house is probably more than every single house put together in my entire town.
Mr.Rangz0r	"Money does not buy happiness" But have you ever seen a sad person on a Jetski?

Daniel Holt	Beyoncé’s live album in the background 😍
Nuper In Nocte	Is it me or is there too much LV.
Sum Tin Wong	Does this house come with condoms. Golden ones
jeywow	i live in somalia   even if they give   me  i will never  take it   ehehheheh
Jay busa	I only have 1 question......WHY?
ewok_111	I find it amusing how the agent mentions the cost of items ad infinitum, as if the mere fact of something being expensive makes it beautiful, or justifies its place in the house. It does not, and as a matter of fact, it should be the other way around - it's because something is beautiful that it's expensive. This is probably the tackiest house I've ever had the displeasure of seeing, and it's no wonder they haven't been able to sell it yet. I still remember when they were asking for $250,000,000. Modern architecture is simply an abomination.
hamza ashfaq	So a hundred and eighty eight million dollars and nothing shoots lasers?
Czambeee	Price included cars inside house??
stephano zondiros	Wow, love watching the things I can’t afford.
mark Alpert	iv got $29 as a down payment .lol

Andromediens	*Sure* *Insane*
Maniak5100	I own this house in GTA 5
Nwokocha Ifechukwu	But I thought It was $ 250 million
PrinceDanza	Anyone else wishing they’d put this house in GTA ?
Satchel	Beautiful beautiful house. I wouldn’t pay that much for a house but it’s still magnificent to look at and appreciate the attention to detail. Afterall, this is an amazing piece of art.
sarge727	and like every other time this same house has been reviewed, this fuckin owner will NEVER EVER get what he is asking for it, primarily because it comes with a whole bunch of gimmicky bullshit, whos only purpose is to prop up the "value" of the house. You have a 35-45 million dollar property with a hundred million in "art". And you can even see the fuckin desperation with this man. It used to be 250M, but everyone saw how stupid that shit is, so now its 188M and i suspect itll keep dropping till it hits about 90M
Jack lin	Only when i play monopoly
Haziq Doublecheese	Just what do these type of people work as to earn this amount of money like wtf
Cadeem Latham	Yeah,Waw,insane,crazy,whistles is the most this guy have said through this entire video
Dan Ordel	And you can buy this mansion and still not happy with your life...😖
Nils Albaum	Anyone knows what music is played at 5:15 ?
Mister Sacca	Disgusting
Ian Meighan	Even if you won the lottery for that 1.6 billion and you bought this you would go broke maintenance and the yearly taxes on this alone will make you lose all your money even if your billing are you still kind of far up this home because you have to literally make a billion dollars a year to for this for the rest of your life or else you'll be losing all your money to maintenance of the mansion and yearly taxes
Israel Aguiar	The bathroom... Crazy, the bar... Crazy, the garage... Crazy, the theater... Crazy, the entire house... Crazy, jajaja!
csantiago719	Wow
HowToStrategy	This used to be 200 mil
Fausto Raimundo	"40 of your closest friends" That guy doesn't know what it means to be friends.
Alexander Heim	Kind of sad that someone who clearly doesn´t appreciate the art that was done in this house, gets a tour around it. But I can understand him. The house is expensive but just looks so cold. I wouldn´t want it even if i had the money.
John Asumaa	Why not just buy a hotel?  The place is about as cozy as an auditorium.  Some folks have way too much money.
TheMasterMind	This is a house but can never be a home
thesloveniaboy123	Money can't buy happiness.
William Ottosson 9D Dacke	do you gonna buy it?
dr1flush	I'm just thinking of that realators commission
Ariana Felicity	who in their right mind thumbs downed this video lol
Aditya Hegde	Might as well add a 100 mil more and build it on the moon
Natsinco	This house is a work of art, but just like art it is overpriced.
Destructo Domain	I heard nothing but crazy and insane and wow
Riojas Productions	Ryan, please invest into a proper videographer for this work. 188 million dollar property, and presented on a shaky video. At least have him get a proper stabilizer. Just saying.
OMGosh Josh	Do not store up your riches on earth where thieves break in and steal and moth destroys. But store up your riches in heaven where neither thieves steal nor moth destroys.
B Sho	I bet whoever lives in that house is miserable as fuck.  Money doesn't bring happiness.
Juarez M.	LOL, no fucking way its worth 188 million.... the house alone is worth 10 million, maybe the place it is built is worth another 30-50 (terrain)..... bullshit....
niels nielsen	it feels so cold. No charm. Empty, monotone lines. Just screams "im modern! i have no soul!"
flex cause I'm on forbes	I'm gonna buy that house
BeastMode M	Funny how this house has been on the market for years.
The D	*If I am Billionaire I would purchase this mansion. It looks and sounds fantastic*
Healthyliving	add a few extra words to your vocabulary dude please if you are going to go see a 190 million dollar house...what's this "crazy"..."insane"? for like 12 minutes
LIEDEL	this house is bigger then my future
Hannes Dendoncker	Music at 10:25?
psixakias	Is it possible to rend it through AirBnB?
Real_Talk 816	I’d buy this house and get half my money back selling all the ugly art.
Little Caesar	It gave me Bruce Wayne vibes
Richard T	There have been like 30 videos made about this house..
khalil elazoui	I only clicked on this, because the guy on the right looked like Paul Walker (no more walking).

egituc	40 of your closest friends... I don’t even know 40 people...
Leo Sundsfjord	Not to be rude or anything but i think reactions was kind of fake if you know what i mean. The only things he says is shure, crazy and insane!!
Tube Crawler	Really? Fire extinguisher champagne bottles. The best choice if you have to decrease a fire in the house. Just fuel it with more alcohol.
Jay Peso	As I'm eating ramen and water all week
MaxxxJo	Offer it on Airbnb 😬
1234bmt	I just watched this video for the music! Fuck being rich
MoonVision	$188mil ? pfft.. chump change to Michael Blakey, just sell a few of his watches and gems.. deal done! :)
Kronikman07	Here's a $350,000 useless piece of shit you'll just look at a couple times in your life. What a great investment, right? And here's a $5 million dollar cool anchor that you wont use, SOOO KEWWWL
Nicky Chimes	That looks horrid, all of it, really disgusting
Etuna Shangheta	That intro reminds me of the prem
Apex Predator	The real home is your grave.
Naaz0099	guy looks like Gru from despicable me
azir64	2:37 Wauw Ryan, did you just lose interest in what the man was saying and turn your back on someone who as speaking?
Samuel Seager	I'm sorry Ryan, but you just don't seem interested in what the host is saying, or the house. You seem bored, or at the very least distracted by something other than the house.
joyce welsh	warren warren where have u been!
Darren Hunt	Thanks cor the great video ....Crazy ...lol ....stubbled up on your vid and loved it !!! I believe u say "crazy" 9 times but you also said "craziest " once :)....next time you should have to count crazy and awesome haha....thx again

Carlos anonimo	lo unico que sabe decir ese guey es "crazy"
Brandonn Harvey	Music near the end showing the helicopter
Monkeypavonis10	This is tyga’s house
Mr. Washington	I forgot to the you guys I pay someone also to wipe my ass after I take a shit. 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
Chris Wylie	Funny how 99% of these mansions in la are owned by "enviornmentally conscious" people who see no problem using up this amount of natural resources and land for their ego. Probably have recycling bins, solar panels....total hypocrits....and they can look down on all the peasants using up appropriate amounts of land per person. Probably "go green" bumper stickers on their 10-20 cars they dont need. And someone is impressed by this?  What gluttony.
HardHead RichKid	This just broke me heart lol
Blake Logan	Wtf 21 bathrooms for what i mean i would set a world record for beating my meat in the most bathrooms
ryan winborne	riveting commentary: crazy , insane, crazy, wow, crazy, insane
Sputz3	“....THATS INSANE....CRAZY....”
Shawna Graham	Why 21 bathrooms? Ffs why? To much just to dam much Give me 1200 acres a decent house on it horses I’m done
luv2boost	it comes with your very own "Airwolf" helicopter. SOLD lol
Mowgl- j	What is this pussy shit? 188M? I pay my son that to mow my lawn!!
Possible	This video is to show us how poor we all really are...
digimon916	Very nice but for purpose and function (a warm place you actually call home), a lot of this is just flashy and useless. its like the house doesnt know if it wants to be a museum, party hall, or a place to raise a family. I think thats a very subtle but powerful factor here.  sometimes you cant just mash everything together. Its like saying you want a luxury truck coupe racecar crossover deisel electric e85.
Mighty Lonesome	Looks more like an exclusive shopping mall. This kind of over indulgence  is like kids with too many toys, they will never play with all of them.
Sean Tottenham	The most unbelievable home I’ve ever seen
Chris Welch	I'll give you 5 bucks for the house
tennaj	Please cut their taxes. They sure need it !  Smh
pizzaDhut	Next time there's an appeal on TV to help starving Africans I will look to the owner of that house to sort it......not me
dumas15	Fucking INSANE incredible Home only if I had generational wealth like SHIEK Money
Froggey	Paul Allen doesn’t live in $25 million dollar house or have $400 million dollar boat cause he’s dead.
Venetian	Why is ryan serhant pissed at the realtor?
JB pedring	That's a lot of stupidity.
hopskipjump	I take it the owner lacks Warren Buffet's class...
Reili o	Yeah if you are gonna spend 188mil design your own.  Didn’t like any of design. Looks like crap from back in the 60/70’s. even with Air wolf parked out on the lawn lol. Probably why it will sit on the market for a very long time.
Right Dude Here	Minus the guy taking the tour having the personality of a telephone pole, it was an interesting video overall.
Skyte	i saw another video on this house and it was $250,000,000
Armando	it's a nice house and all, but most of the money is going to expensive rocks and unnecessary stuff
Jacooobb	I love luxury things
Random uploader Ed	Can someone tell if the cars and the furniture come with the house
Isma DD	What if the owner got accidentally blind, deaf and paralyzed? Does it still make worth to him $188m? When Steve Jobs in his dying bed, his billion dollar never worth anything. 🤔 I just think so....
Jati Gaming	Never felt so poor in my life
Northern_ Savage	The electric bill is probably the price of the damn house..
Shane Liberty	Take all the goddy shit out of the house and it’s worth 1/4 of asking price.   Check google maps for 924 Bel Air.  There’s a bigger house next door and neither home anywhere near the ocean.  You’re a sucker if you buy this.
Giorgio Facelli	song name at 5:12?
Luis	Im so disgusted ! on hwow to much is just to much! Again go on a tour and feed children that are dying and suffering from hunger in africa or something !  What a messed up world
Squatting Squirrel	And here I work 60 hours a week and barely have a savings hmm
Gen X	Wandering around a house repeating “insane” “ crazy” over & over like an illiterate High School stoner flunky..... not really a “ vlog”  🤔Insane!!!
Berceski ?	I’m just saying, if you have this amount of money and still be one of those people that say money does get you happiness then you should try being happy on 2 dollars a day.
Aaron Kilty	I love luxury listings
milesgti	Crazy
liquidpersuasion	I could probably get a mansion like this.... in GTA V
Mike Tyson	if i had 188mil i would never even be in my home
Cletus Sawyer	Ugly as fuck...ill take my two story 250k farm house with wrap around porch on 20 acres out in the country over this piece of shit.
Nope Nope	Rip Paul allen
ROMAIN WHITE	I got some great gems here, definitely going to do a extra home improvement
Yousef Mohammadi	Eminem: Money doesn't buy happiness, It buys CRAZYASS HAPPINESS.
Animal	I'm sorry, but I just don't see the value proposition.  This isn't a home, it's a storage space for useless junk.  In fact, it's criminal in a way...
8D Nation	This is the type of house that I can live with my closest friends,relatives and partners!
K O'Finnigan	Who wants to live in an art museum/hotel resort? Seems kinda cold/lifeless... just sayin.
Ronan C	Still gotta wipe your own ass.      Or... do you?
Arcade Room	Nothing special. The nature will rise against you!
gemstarstation	Wow. I want that house. Richie Rich.
Guerline Janvier	Some rich people spend thier money in stupid thing have of the thing they showing in the house that cost a lot of money is ugly I guess because of the name ... but why do someone want to spend that much money in one house when we have so much homeless people and so much people that’s a needs and other kids that’s suffering . If I had that much money I Would be a blessing to so many people and help them out because when I died I can’t take that house with me
huntingsynth	If you had that much money why would you want to live in Bel Air
Steve Holmgren	Crazy Rich White People
Ehiz I	Every item In this house is the most expensive item in the world
Calum Palmer-Alexander	It’s like the best episode of Cribs that ever existed
Nicholas Smith	Even if I could easily afford this home, I still wouldn't buy it. The home looks far too sterile, and it looks really uninviting. With a home this large, you leave yourself vulnerable to so many variables. Sure, you could hire a 24/7 security detail, possess a state-of-the-art surveillance system, but I would always live in paranoia because of who comes in and out.
SweepTheMind	Using this amount of money for a house that isnt a very good shelter.. this people made money, and not much else
king blueprint	That house insane
Joshua Molina	This dude sounds so sarcastic lol
Spencer Hoppock	My brother and I are buying this next month.
YoYoMacaro	insane.
Teo Laitila	And then there is poor African people who dont have a home..
FireWITfire op	Unless my family was really REALLY BIG..i wouldn't feel comfortable living in this house...a family kinda person...this cleaely shows that the world is not evenly distributed...how?...HOW?
Jay. G35x	CHECK OUT MY NEW YOUTUBE CHANNEL
TC14KID	I have no clue what I would do with all that space
Iestyn Hughes	😍😍😍
Michael Summerell	Tacky. For those whose motivation is the monetary value of things and showing off rather than good taste.
Sling Shot	Rest assured, God will have mercy on us pawns because he can let loose his anger on people who dare live in such kind of houses and pretend to enjoy art and known brands, drives million dollars cars and drinks for thousands of $ a night. That's what we know they do, I wonder what's available for the underground market for billionnaires. Just kidding, I know what's up, that's why I make this comment, if you are not aware, please buckle up and follow the white rabbit down the rabbit hole, your life won't ever be the same.

Hello Plugin	Zillow currently values the property @ $44,891,757.  So all that crap inside cost more that the complex.  What are you going to do with all that stuff? Garage Sale?  How much for the helicopter and the pile/stack of orange rocks?
Alex Newman Veloso dos Santos	It's fun to see things I'll never be able to afford.
Joshua Espinoza	"thats crazy" "thats insane" we get it bro
Saurav Anand	That's Dope. To all people saying it's not worth it, man, you just can't afford it.

Now, I feel grounded Lol)

John Spurrier	I don't know how you make this much money. But, I do know people who own businesses and spend money on absurdities such as these (not at the same decimal point, but unnecessary trinkets).   Their biggest complaint in life is labor wages. It's a sickness.

Nick Coulter	It seems like more of a hotel/resort type atmosphere than a home, but it would be pretty cool to do a week vacation there or something.
Lars Slate	Honestly if I was given that house for free not sure I would even enjoy it. At some point too much is too much. 10 people laughing and having fun with each other in that living room is no different than 10 people doing the same in a 150k house living room.  Excessive for the purpose of excessive is not even impressive.    Would rather have Sir Richard Branson’s Necktar Island which is primitive compared to this place.

Thore	I think the house is extremely cool but I think all these lv stones and the syringe, etc. just too much, just like the camera under the stairs. I could not do it if there are still 100 other people in your own house, which are just cleaning, etc. Cool house but set too much that I do not need
Sniipzy	can someone tell me who this bruce guy is the guy keeps mentioning. Thanks.
The Disabled Gamer	I'm speechless !

Mr. & Mrs. Carr	10 of my houses couldnt even come close to covering the down payment...
Pedro L	This is where a super villain would live  😂
Frank Simmons	Yearly property tax on the that gaudy place is a waste of money.  No one wants that place, with the price constantly being lowered. Most likely, has an insane/outrageous property insurance with being in an earthquake zone (on top of the extreme property tax) and high monthly up-keep. Plus the staff to maintain the place, one would be losing money yearly. A property is only what one is willing to pay. Just waiting for it to sell is costing a fortune (every year).  Add up the property tax, insurance, HOA, Staff, maintenance/up keep, utility bills and you would be losing money yearly in comparison to the hopeful appreciation, if any.
ScoobyDoobster	*insane* *awesome* *thats crazy*
South Side	In Texas you can get all this for 25 million
billgoro17	Shit taste and a waste of money. This "house" looks like a luxury clinic. This is what happens when end goal is hoarding money. They get it and don't know what to with it. Buying luxury cars and motorcycles just to lock them up in the house for show. There should be prison sentences for such moronic wastefulness.
Carlos Rodriguez	Somebody is not paying high taxes

chronok	2 years and 2 mil for that staricase? Uhhh now I know a thing or two polishing large steel surfaces to high optical quality with 0.25 micron diamond but that price is just flat out robbery :D It's probably valued as an art-piece, not as a functional part/building of the house.

And in terms of style its nothing special. 350m for no style. shiny things and channel and louis vuitton stamps everywhere, the essence of kitch and tacky glamour. Channel and louis vitton stuff make me wanna thow up on sight.
Fake Konyo	do not make any excuses. you all do not like this house because no.1 you cannot afford it! if you say that it has no taste... i think your taste is at the very lowest level or none. i love this house. if i can afford this kind of lifestyle, if i am rich, no doubt i would love to give this house to my wife and future kids and to live here forever! who doesnt dream to have a cook driver and servants? u nuts? i would love that. but i will be honest... i cannot afford this house. i could not even afford even a single decoration in this house so for me, it will just be a dream to even be in this house.haha! how i wish i can have somthing like this. that would be a miracle! really haha! but i stick to reality... at this moment i cant. i think the owner of this house is really smart and intelligent and full of luck! because its not 123 to have this kind of luxury. whoever you are sir madam, i want to follow your steps. can you mentor me? seriously... i want to make a fortune and change the world to a better place from scratch coz obviously, i have nothing at the moment. but i dont know how... maybe you can teach me sir/ madam? thank you. i dont need your money, i just need knowledge. hope you grant my request. i will wait for your response. have a great day ahead of you and may you have more blessings especially healhty living always. God bless you! :) fb: #rejansadventures
Georgi Georgiev	You don't just call these pieces of art 'nuts'. Teach yourself a few words.
LarryUK	What a ridiculous waste of money. This is what is wrong in the world. 60,000 people are living on the streets in California, yet a few miles away someone can live in such opulence. There really is no need for it. The greed of the rich will end the human race. Putin's new castle makes this look like a shed too.

Mechanical Sausage	188 million for that... it’s an epic place with custom quirks, features and detail second to none but 188 is clearly an asking price not a valuation. You’ve show cased 50 million dollar properties equally as impressive over the years

And whoever ends up buying it will STILL not have a fulfilled life ...oh the irony of the super rich and their vaccuuos existence
Justin Dylan	That was insane
Julien Chevallier	"Thank you brother" lol
Ash Sherr	ha gay like your face.
Jack park	No reason to have a 200 million dollar house. This is just a way for rich people to feed their insecurity.

Saki630	Cool place, but where are the bedrooms, bathrooms, gamer-rooms?
red stain	I could win the mega million jackpot. And I still wouldn't buy this house. Over priced and most of these things are not needed in my everyday life. Its more like a art museum than a house. And what will I do with a 21 bathroom? Its like shitting in 21 different houses. Lmaooooo. 😀 its pretty but I won't live here. And a house party wouldn't be fun. Bc you'll be paranoid that someone may break something or steal something.  So Im good. Less stress and I'll be just content in what I have thank you very much. Haha.
Hazzanimated	that's insane
Exe Psyche	90% of his response are "that's crazy" and "that's insane". That would be my response too. LOL

Glendene Cripgang	I rather buy 188 people a million dollar house each
AwakeRelax - VFX	Life's better in Jannah, people wake up, don't be fooled by this world, it is a mere deception. There's no material thing you will take with you when you die, the only thing is your belief and your good deeds.
GotherL	This house just looks to materialistic. Doesn't feel like a home rather like some kinda high-end art gallery. Who would wanna live in one of these, I mean if they can afford it that is...
Rusu Traian Cristian	Hmm, yeah, $50m tops to build this. Rest is pure profit due to the fact you get over the hassle and is already built + the zone, Beverly Hills. Still way too overpriced. But nice. And like someone else mentioned, even if I were a Billionaire, I either would not spend $188m on a house or, if I would, I would spend that money on something with my own design. So yeah. Pretty irrelevant. Still nice!  You guys get my drift.
Haitian Picasso	''come back anytime ..'' if you got money to buy the house lol
Matthew Juarez	Looks like tyga house
Current Motion	2:54 250 million dollar mega-estate on the print material but it's listed for 62 million less while the guy pitches it's going to appreciate in value.
The Mighty Gerbil	...It's hideous, totally hideous. It's like someone visited an upscale mall and decided they wanted to live in one less comfortable.  I'd always feel like somebody's watching me (reference FTW) in this "house" and be horribly self conscious if I didn't walk around fully clothed all the time. Nothing cozy or private about any of the rooms and don't get me started on the art aesthetic. Who wants to stare at luggage even if it's carved out of the rarest unobtainium rocks. If you enjoy looking at your money that much just have a money bin like Uncle Scrooge because you could at least swim in it then :p .  I know this house isn't currently lived in but I always wonder where rich people put all the normal junk you know they have to have. Is there like a room the servants stuff all of it in when company comes over or do they just not show the 1% of the house they actually live in? Even if you pay people to do things you are still going to have your phone charger somewhere, kleenex, trash cans, pens, pencils and papers. There are tons of incidental things you want close at hand and not behind cabinet doors because you use them often. "I'm going to sneeze just let me hold it as I walk to the other side of the mansion and open a cabinet for a tissue". That's just not feasible if it's not out in the open near you.
igrvks	Didn't Notch buy this house at some point? I have a vague memory of those candy dispensers and the giant camera thing from some article.
TwohandLagoon006	Nice ill take it!
DeletedChannel	A helicopter 😱😪I feel poor
paul williams	There is a difference between unique decor and needlessly spending money.  This house had little appeal to me, personally, just because everywhere you looked is the same question and same boring answer. "Oh that's unusual, what's the story with _____?"      "When you spend enough to put a dozen kids through undergrad and medical school you can build a really dope staircase or whatever other ridiculous shit you want."
bamboo	this place doesn't look like a home

JimmY	"enjoy your asset" jees what kind of a shallow life must you live to not purchase something unless it can make you more money? its never enough money for these greedy people is it, only want more more more. Just fucking enjoy what you have and let the money reach the hands of people who need it and who work harder than you, rather than hoard it in your bank

jahen vazquez	It started as 250 million dollars now its 188? This home for me is worth 50 million
Yasu Leone	They focus on getting the most expensive materials, rather than getting the highest quality design. Warren Buffet said, "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get." Value and price are different things. Personally, I don't see the value in getting the most expensive stone because there are prettier, yet cheaper facade options. And the 300K sink had a chip out of it. Why not get a nice zen stone sink instead?  Awesome house though.
Kim Roy	hehe no one wants this house.. i've seen this mansion since 2015

CCole	this is so over the top if i had 10 billion dollars i would never buy a house like this. i mean i like the design of the house but i find all the stupid little decorations that are all 50k plus completely absurd. idk why anyone would want any of that. i would much rather give that money to charity or something. on the other hand the contents of the garage is something that i would want.

Only difference is what they can afford shiny rocks and minerals and metals, nothing more.

Lucas Johnson	When this house has more bathrooms then your highschool
Steven T	First person to count how many times he says "'sure'' gets what ever Ryan serhant wants to give away XD
matty mc	Did we see any rooms or anything? Felt like it was just certain areas. And if it rains? That big screen? Hmm
Carl Montefiore	Wankers, cold have spent the money on solar power to a 3rd world country
Yoongay and HoesuCk	my sugar daddy COULD NEVER
Apollo Sun	Mr Serhant is the man, if I was ever going to buy or sell in NY, he would be my number one choice. Thanks for the vid.
Delay is King	What happens if it rains?
Mein Herz	While some are wasting the money like crazy... others are dying cause they dont have not even a dollar per day... life is hard
Subsme	*cRaZy*
Adrian Sánchez	You're so disrespectfull. He's saying interesting facts about the house and you ignore him like a little child. AND the worst Is that you don't have any other words to express yourself than INSANE or CRAZY. DUMB AF
mikael	I'd be embarrassed to own this house.   This is what greed gets you, a world where people 'need' 'everything'.   Capitalism at its purest.
Black Hawk	Franklins mansion?
a0r1a0	total miss use and unecesary resources, the house is an amazing piece of architecture but the things inside are expensive for nothing, having a 350k facet is useless when a $200 one will do, just pointless and makes you a target to get robbed, not to mention is way overpriced but smart billionares and millionares wont buy this house, only people looking to flex and party like rappers, actors etc. and event hosters looking to entertain
Cxle Garrett	Train me to do what you do please ✊
ScottKipple	do a shot everytime Ryan says "insane"

Stewart Phillips	*Act rich act rich act rich act rich*
Tahn Jandai	Whoa
raventhorX	Wow this house is insane, honestly I find a majority of the features of the house to be a large waste of money, of course if the person living in the house has the money to blow then why not, but I honestly wouldn't buy a house with so many things that are that expensive. It's mostly the materials things are made out of, like the stairs and that sunk, why would you need those to be that expensive? Overall design and square feet of the house is awesome though, but I would invest my money in just the design, square feet, and materials that get the job done properly and nothing money. Bet this house would drop in price by a good $50 million or more if they used regular materials that are good enough for what you need and nothing more.
Savaged Pepe	so its not really just the house that costs so much its more the location and whats inside of it
Daniel Cooper	This is what I'm buying with that $1.6 Billion lottery
shoottheglass	House comes with AirWolf!!! totally worth it.
niño rata	Canelo needs 2
andy wong	This looks like a house from GTA V
Sammy Cree	It’s nice to watch this, it shows me how shitty my life is
Cortion Carter	I never understood why these mansions have more bathrooms than bedrooms. I thought it would be an even amount between the two or 70/30-60/40
Gerardo Ramos	Who immediately thought of the movie goal during the song in the beginning
Carpe	Who's here because the jackpot is 1.6 billion?
ennio lorenzana	money  cant make u happy :v

PoLLuX Clan	Who ever buys that house is just crazy. Why do you need a helicopter? I have so many questions. The staircase alone cost 30x more then my house.
O'Bryan Debonaire	#perfection
Revoloution	So your telling me for 15 years I've spelt and said "Manshion" instead of Mansion My life is a lie.

Gadgetbig	I wouldn’t want the electric bill on that place
1,000 subs with No videos?	Alrighty I can put down a $50 down payment, hook me up!
Alex Smith	To be honest, the design and furnishings are pretty gauche. For all the money blown on this house, they could have at least made it interesting or put that money into good design and not tacky carved rock replicas of Louis Vuitton and Hermes bags. This is a true sad waste of money.
Motaz Elsawaaf	Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane....Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ,,,Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane....Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane....Insane,,,,,Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane....Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane,,,,,Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane....Insane....Insane ....Insane ....Insane ....Insane...come on, your uber driver is waiting for you outside

Malith Perera	But why?
Tomas Bodnar	Who the fuck would want to live there lol. I like my 2 story modest home, screaming kids and all. Its home. This place would make anyone feel small and insignificant, good luck finding 40 fake people to hang with lol
C.M Mac	The most unattractive home ever!

Lasagna titty	Looks better in Bo2 tbh
Randominator	This is retarded. A fucking bowling alley? What? Waste of money. I'm all for luxury but this is just.... stupid. If you're rich, buy a big expensive luxury apartment
Miko Morin	i love luxury listings
AhKoKo	So pretty much a robber can pick up anything even a brick is good enough?
toothless toe	Living in such a house would be the ultimate superfluity. I'm content with my bare minimum of needs and wants met.
MrG0TH1ER	This house is just stupid... What kind of loser needs to spend all that money on cheezy decor...
Crazzynet	Is that Mr Wonderful???
Hector Rivadeneyra	I rather live in Tilted Towers
Derek Best	if im paying 190 million im gonna have a nice little place in the middle of no where sitting on 10,000 acres. Not to mention not living in a commie state.
Cobra69	Okay so buy a 188 million dollar mansion... with shit in it that no one gives 2 flying F*cks about to allow only people who don't appreciate it inside.. Yeeaahh I think ill settle far away from California for a bigger place with less useless shit in it and a bigger house that doesn't even cost a mere fraction of the price. Paying for a street address with so called "Art" inside...
B Veezy	This place is lame as shit.
tim schonewolf	this is amazing and "crazy" and all but this amount of money is just stupid. like the people who actually have this much money to build this let alone buy it is beyond insane. spread the wealth help the community give to others
Abdulaziz Alkatheri	Can i get 2 of these please including delivery !          I meant Ryan's book don't get me wrong :)
Rothschild Scum	You'd have to sell your soul to get that mansion.
Pierre Forest	I'm not hating, but I was totally unimpressed...
Tj Cherry	Thought of buying it...but I've got finals next week

Michael Goodman	These rich twats wouldnt know how to build or make a single stick of that home.

John Iii	Ryan looks like shit here that mustache and all of that is not working for him
Mati V	if I had a dollar for every time he said "insane" "crazy" or "wow" id be able to buy this house LOL follow my twitch mati2637
r2dxhate	So useless. Why would anyone build this crap? Who would ever need a house like that? How could you ever utilize that much space? If you threw a party big enough to use the whole house, they'd probably ruin all the extravagant materials.
eyes open	Stone luggage 🤭🤢🤮 that stone is amazing and they made fake bags out of them🤣🤣 stupid
Kiefer Simmins	Yeah but is it insane
jec1ny	I'm sorry, but this is just vulgar. It's conspicuous consumption magnified by a factor. "Hey everybody, look at me! I have more money than God but not an ounce of good taste."
styner3	The helicopter is for show only, it does not fly. It's illegal to fly a helicopter in that area.
Jane Bone	what's 21 mean?
J Tapia	Whos bruce?
Gas'n'Oil	A lot of cool pieces, superb craftsmanship, high quality materials - everything comes together to make one hell of a ghastly house. Cannot imagine who would want to live there.
Church Vs State	I build some of the best wine cellars in America and that one is horrible, The first thing I would remover or after the giant camera.
Saved by Christ	I don't even know how much money that it! Pretty much only kylie jenner could afford this house!
AFIF AHK	Waste of money i wouldnt live in thar big house because you do not need it
robin tang	For anyone that says only a retard would buy this house... Dont be ignorant. Real estate is one of the best ways to spend 200 mill... didnt you hear what the dude said in the beginning? Enjoy the shit out of your asset and at the end of the day, you can get a lot of it back.
brightful5	Jeremy from jersey just subscribed
Legacy Slayer	Mark my words, I will live here or someplace like it
Flash1026 #801	#Jesus Christ is coming quickly...repent and accept Christ as your savior!
Max Zen	I am going to buy it :-)
John D	I guess nobody would buy the mansion at $250 million so they had to bump it down to $188 million.  Still the most expensive house for sale in the U.S.?  😂

Jake Crecelius	Just give me a cabin with wifi and 200k I'm fine
Michael Carr	Hey my house has a helicopter that doesn’t even fly  WOW!
Emilio Arroyo	I can’t imagine how much time it would take to wipe all the dust out, or simply clean all the house. I can’t even have my own room cleaned.
Alec Bishop	I would pay 6 hundred  36 trillion for this house
n26 klay	When people say sure as much as he did they sound uninterested and rude.

Sammy Morini	That sink is worth more than my house... talk about throwing money down the drain.
JJbcam69	Who is the idiot who originally financed this monstrosity?  You have to hold a massive party every night, or this is one lonely house.  Plus....this thing is really hard to move.  The market of people who could afford this and want it, is  probably just a handful.  I'm a hardcore capitalist, but this is flat out wasteful.  Instead of building this monument to ego, why not build a beautiful, proper home like a real human being, and use the difference to help millions of people less fortunate. Or invest it back into a business that creates good jobs.  But this is ridiculous.  Any individual who would build this should be ashamed of themselves.
HaMa Darin	if i had a million every time this guy said ''crazy or insane'' i would have been able to afford this house
ilikebigtitss	This two guys really pissed me off
Rod Lafleur	Anyone who has a place like this has got to be an idiot

Willluft113@gmail	Hey let's live in a resort mall! Yeah that's insane.
l3g3nd1337	This is dan bilzerian house
O K	For anyone who wonders, the movie club that guys refers to costs $100k to join and then $4000 a month 🙃
MrJrlemons3	It's an incredible piece of architecture.  However, it's just too much.  I mean it's just no need for a lot of that stuff and it's just there to be seen.  No functionality whatsoever.  That's a bachelors party pad.  It's not somewhere I could call home.  Home has a feel to it and I don't think this place gives that.  But hey I'm a family guy so what do I know.
PlanetTerra	So ostentatious.
OneQuickie plz	All those fire extinguishers in one place 🤔 just why. Fire opposite side of house there is no way to put it out without being The Flash.

Joshua Smith	If the Theater chairs aren't silent massage chairs, I don't want it.
Ben Rezki	In the beginning of the video, I thought Ryan would say "You're crazy" to that guy. 10 minutes later I guess Ryan elaborate that expression into several 'crazy' and 'insane'. I really wonder if Ryan could sell that mega mansion.
Hudo	I’m not gonna even gonna earn 100k in my whole life ;)
Team Astro RL	This guy sounds just as anti social as me.
shipper66	The bathroom sink in this house is worth more than my house. Nice.
Tyler Rumpler	Isnt this dan bilzerians house?
E Double	This house was first listed for $250 million. Must have a hard time selling.
otbway	The problem with selling this house is people with the money and ambition to buy a house like this will want to decor it with what they want they value the most... Even if he is passionate about cars and there is a car room with collector items... People would want to design there own custom car room and put their own cars... It's not just about buying it but there is a story behind everything in the house, and if I am living in a house like this I want everything in it to speak to me... So I would buy just the outside shell of that house and stripped it off all things and decor it to my own liking..
KNG N	OMG Literally my favorite house in the world with my favorite singer, entertainer playing in the house 0:34  That would be so me 😂😍
Flick	everyone doesnt want to buy the home i would fuck me that shit is big
granddaddyHerps	looks more like a shopping mall than a house. I've seen homes for a few mil that take my breath away. not impressed
wss w	California has the richest man and woman and best house.
Hector Sand	And then, we have those 10,000 migrants in the caravan from Honduras, thinking that one day they are going to live in a place like this. The American dream, they think.
ACE 54	Has anyone even bought this house yet?
mironyuk	I dont envy a penny of these billionaires, cuz Jesus said most of them will have a horrible afterlife & the poor and righteous will inherit the earth forever
Ryan Koehler	The estimate on this house is 44 million. You're buying all the baggage shit with it
jacekvo jace	waste of money

Wilmer Constanzo	Wasn't this house 250 million dollars and now they dropped it
Dustin Platt	I probably couldn't even afford to put a roll of toilet paper in every bathroom.
Nick Gang	Do you get the cars with the house
Scotty MSU	lets fill a house with shit and sell it for an equally insane price...
D&M Productions	This house used to be 250 million about a year ago, why'd the value go down so much?
Oh yeah yeah	All the artwork is pretty grotesque
Salvador Garcia	the person to buy this wipes his as with hundres
Lo']['uZ	Its a hotel not a home. But, yiu gottan put that money somewhere.
Peppa Pug	‘We put together a 3 minute demo for you, sit back and enjoy.’ - plays a Dolby ad
cartoon craver	My immature ass would try flushing every toilet in the house before the first toilet starts making  the flushing sound
Tiff T	Go Beyonce jammin in the background 😁
J	The commision on that sale must be insane.
joelshack85	Republicans + Democrats = Pay play  Pay to play = Crony capitalism   Crony capitalism = the swamp  The love affair between big business, lobbyists, and pimped out senators makes for the swamp. If not for this love affair billionaires would not exist. We operate and have been for centuries on the belief the “free market” has enabled America to be what it is. That’s not true the love affair between big business and the feds have. I’ll let you decide if Crony capitalism is a good thing or not. But no matter what you decide Crony capitalism is a very real reality in our day in age!
navyregrets	Somebody buy Ryan a thesaurus so he can come up with other ways of saying, "crazy," "awesome," and "insane."  Can't tell if he's impressed with the house or if he's cracking wise about the stupidity of it all...
Sim Won	disgusting
Da Shridla	Guess I know what I'm buying if I win the lottery... As an investment of course..
stateofharzie	this gotta be the most unimpressed guy ever with his "insane" "cool" "amazing" "nuts".. did i say "insane" in the most boring tone
GONE IN 108 SECONDS	I thought it was only $ 250 million
愛Chihiro	Why the fuck would you need all that shit, sounds depressing
Ferdinand Spirit	What most people dont realize is that most of todays "marketers" on the interweb rent out mansions like these to make themselves look rich and have you give them your hard earned money so that then they can buy a mansion that equals the size of the one the already have. "And I know moved into a better mansion you guys. Believe me!"
? Ahmed	These are self centered individuals.  Yet with all these not contempt and sleeplessness.
Jonart Nickson Martin	Imagine buying this house and dying the next day due to a nuclear blast..like you’ve only used 1/21 bathrooms and have only slept in 1/12 bedrooms and haven’t even used the helicopter nor swim in the gigantic pool.You haven’t even tried to extinguish a fire with champagne nor laid you hands on the million dollar camera.Don’t even get me started on the cars, you haven’t even tried how fast the fastest motorcycle really is and  how about that multi million dollar theater downstairs?...i would re-kill myself😏
KILLUSALL92	even Escobar himself would think this was a bit much
Angry Shark	I thought it was 250 million?

TheFatCatt	Take a shot every time he says insane or crazy
khantil makhat	Who is stupid enough to buy this house? that's the question.
Ivan Lazarov	Money doesnt buy you happiness, nor does big ass cars, houses. How much deaths does it take to own this house? How much suffering and harm must be unleashed unto the world? Death does not create life. Sorrow does not create happiness.  Milion miles away or at your doorstep, whats the difference? You cant escape memories.
Mark Liu	This is just Ridiculious u would need to spend couple of hundred thousand dollars per year just to entertain guests or family it’s self
Martin Ren	Would be nice giving a little big just a little for little kids starving to death would be real nice
MiGrowB MiGrowB	I'm gonna buy this house in two months after I hit the mega millions jackpot tomorrow.

Adrianna Bergen	Speechless......
ObsessionPC	Well...it's never too late to become a billionaire. Still, the place feels mostly cold, like most mansions. Yet it is one of the best and nicest unreal places I have ever seen. Hats off to the designers. It is a work of art.
Alphonzo Escolar	You said 12 crazies in this video but the last one (12th), you said craziest. I don't know if that is counted. You also said 8 insanes in this video. I hope I still get to win a signed book I'm a fan :). Thank you Ryan! You and your channel are an inspiration to me. I live in the Philippines and was brought up poor. The reason I watch your videos is to fix my mindset because I haven't been to expensive neighborhoods. I was brought up to a scarcity mindset and really want to be extremely successful. I'm 24 right now and at 50, I'll buy my own mansion. Love you! more power to you and your channel!
Robert wilson	well if i win the 1.6bil mega i know what house im buying lol

Dead Channel	His house cost 250 mil last year, now it cost 188 mil?
SuperBizzle10	wasnt this house worth  250 million not a long while a go i guess billionaires are not that stupid lol
Michael Campos	That's my kind of house. Looks like I'm going to need to get my helicopter pilots license.
Davis	Is this the house that keeps getting featured on tv but no one wants to buy? I feel like I have seen it many times. Even the rich people know it’s a rip off
daniel sullivan	Mega millons winner gets it
random person scrolling the comments	I have a goal in live now

Rune Christensen	A year ago this was $250 million....
verge	Songs??
Maximillian TM	Can’t tell if that house is insane or not
Cameron Anglin	That’s dudes all ab the money
Jordan Sipe	It's a really nice house but the sheer level of unecesecary flamboyance that rich people put in their homes and then blame the working class for problems makes me cringe.  The guy has the fucking fastest motorcycle in the world and he keeps it in a museum rather than than on the ground... where it should be.
liam mortimer	I’m rich and wanna fuck Bruce , crazy
BAM_CAM G	Wow that’s insane!
STRIKEGANG	All this money in the world I still don’t get how its people out here starving ain’t no house worth that much idc how luxury it is

Lucas Harrington	If I lived here the only time I would leave my room would be when I go to school because my step mom we be soo scared me or any of my 4 siblings would break something😂😂
Ryan Schuch	“This house has everything” shit it better have everything if I’m spending $200 million.
MrSkyl1ne	Holy sht that's one ugly ass house :/ No style, no ambiance, just a pile of expensive stuff because it's expensive. I'd get depressed from living there. If i had 188mln to spend on a house, it'd look nothing like this.
Extreemy	Game stop price: $2.55  is max I can do
Jeff S	When this house was actually on the show million dollar listing, they mentioned that the helicopter came with the house, but it was not zoned (or allowed) for helicopters to take off and land there. I wonder if that has been taken care of by now. Otherwise, no point in having it unless you like it as a lawn ornament.
Big Master	Over inflated price
Joe Bryce	And heavens way way better
Thomas Thompson	When I win the lottery I’ll buy this house
Jarno	This is a clear example of money can't buy style lmfao this house ugly AF !!!
hypnosao Edits	think of this house and then just think about what bill gates could buy
Harry Akakpo	If I had a dollar everytime Ryan said “insane” or “crazy”, I’d be able to afford this house
Ryan Duffield	What song is playing in the intro
alex guerrero	Dan owns this house
Meredith Wright	Going to buy that house in 3 years.
xXxJSHxXx	sorry this will sell for 70-90 miljon max...
Tripp Miller	Ubnoxious and gawdy.
Saul Lucero	Can't sell this pice of sh*t yet Bruce.
Gary W-l-o-t	Hillary has two and probably never stepped foot in either one
bdot toronto	21 bathrooms, I could shit all day

Jeff Jeferson	Money doesn’t buy happiness they say
Ian Bower	crazy
Geezee	I saw a video on youtube the same house last year costed 250M and now 188M lol
Jonathan Pape	I’ve noticed that insanely expensive homes like these all have random shit like Louis Vuitton furniture and gold handlebars and designer marble and stupid shit like that that no normal person would buy. If my house was that expensive it would have actual things inside worth money. Not a $3,000,000 sink or whatnot.
E9xLEVI	It was $250 mil when it first went on the market right???
Please Read	Who cares
BrendanMalone	Someday I’ll live in a house in this tier.
Joseph Ochoa	Man lmao he was not impressed at all
Harry Lee	I said Crazy at least 7 times.  And, yes, that also made me sad to realize how different life is out there.  Can I ever be able to live in a house like that even for a day?
spektakelkd	Didn't that other guy catch on?   It was a competition in amounts of "crazy" uttered.
enfekted13	I'd love to smack the owner in the face and say, but it you and 3 other people.. your spending a hundred thousand dollars a month for looks.. idiot! SMACK!!! I don't care how much money you have, but why waste it when you can help others and feel better..smh
savage pedro	I would sell all that bs art 😂😂  and make my money back fuckkk you mean
TurkishStyles52	To sum it up..       Crazy Insane
Kermit The Architect	by far one of the ugliest thing I've ever seen. The decors specialty is not being expensive, its being horrid. Who the hell designed the interior. Nothing that has been presented was something that was sincere or really had a spirit of a house. For that money, I would buy the plot and built my own house from scratch, and would still have more than 150 million dollar left.
Rauf M	This is the kind of shit wealthy people will buy and then 2 months down the road when they start to feel depressed and lonely in a big ass house, will say that money doesn't buy happiness.. 🤦
its me	Where can I sign my check...
The 570 Experience	He was beat up as a child
Will B	To me something that big wouldnt feel like home
Aqib Hussain	I’ll take two
MR W4TERMELON3	Get tf outa my house what wall 2 doin??
yullyi fullyi	i have one bathroom 🙃
Austin Jones	House is old news and outdated--it's still based in reality. Homes in the future will morph from this to a house in Bali to a house in Paris... all virtually.
Golf Nomad	Is this an Air B&B? I can’t find it..
Justice Warrior	They had to play Beyonce for giving that extra trashy feel...
sactown916	I don’t have 40 close friends. I’m sure if I had the money for this house finding friends wouldn’t be hard
Just-A-Username	*Sponsored by Louis Vuitton*
Bradley Giddens	Everything in that house is so over the top
Neon Beach Raver’s	Crazy. Ill get you jonny
Uriel Mendoza	Wasn’t it 250Million ?
EnlockTV	It was selling for $250 million according to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOjJ2BhKCnw Did they lower the price because they couldn't sell it? 🤔
b00ksi	Imagine playing hide and go seek...
Mr Dusty	Am I the only one that doesn't want people working in my house?
IARRCSim	10:00 are those servers?  The video is slow moving even when they're showing a bunch of stupid candy.  Then, they fast forward through what appears to be the most interesting technology of the house.
alex ruiz	Come back anytime. Oh boy well that’s a lie isn’t it ?
SilentViper	Dude really said 0-120 in 3 seconds
Lemonzify	Right.
The Deadlytes	Still wouldn’t get it if I hit the 1.6 billion dollar jackpot. I’d rent it out for a month and have a party every night. This is possible.
Darrothan	Getting GTA vibes from that Helicopter
SAIDwithSILENCE	@H3H3productions ??? Thoughts??
Dan Schapira	Checking in before the mega millions drawing
Lil Pahl	Easily could afford that
Fer DLC	188 million? That's barely anything
Cometa Soulstar	40 of your closest friends? lol, that's a lot of friends, and those are of course just your closest ones.
Machinist 4375	I would buy the house sell all the art except the big camera ..sell all the cars except the moto..sell the helicopter sell everything in it that's worth money ..then re sell it
Thoughts of a peer	LOL, real estate doesn't outpace DOW JONES! wtf
Colin Page	Meanwhile, in that very same state, some kid will go to bed hungry tonight and a veteran will go to sleep in the street. disgusting.
Real Madrid sponsored by UEFA	How will that ever feel like a cosy home.
insane_assailant	And when you die you have to leave it all....makes no sense
raymond moncion	if i remember correctly im pretty sure dan bilzarian bought this house
Hans Solo	A person would have to be really vain and self absorbed to own this type of home. Who really needs all that crap!?
Flames N/a	Wow what I want to know how much it would be for the up keep of that house n u can't pilot the helicopter because if you do your neighbors are going to get mad nobody wants to hear that especially at night imagine if something breaks how much is going to be to fix it wow
Qiu S	Haa haa. No amount of money can make you live longer than an average person.
Waves	o
scott smith	Just a suggestion but buy a thesaurus. Awesome, insane, and crazy, is usually used by teenagers when they see a Ferrari for the first time. I was half expecting you to say 'bitchin'...

ChaotikBlaze	The bowling alley is gold I remember this house with air wolf replica helicopter  was 225,000,000 or higher
Cythisis	The clout house looks like a soup kitchen compared to this
Don T	This is nothing compared to my mega mansion in Minecraft
Music to the People	Disgusting excess at it's finest. Whoever buys this is a worthless self centered human with no heart. How can people live with themselves in a house like this knowing there's people literally picking from garbage piles just to survive and even worse people starving to death. Fuck this house.
MILKY	cool house but they have obviously been having a difficult time selling this one as they were initially asking for $250 million when they were first trying to sell
cjeam	This is for exceedingly unimaginative rich people. Nothing about the house makes it worth $188million. It’s an expensive location, and it’s big, but the structure of the house is not special, it’s normal construction and not worth any more than a similar property in that area.   My house is worth £180k. If I fill it with £1million of overpriced furniture, is it a £1.18million house?
keyboardbeats	All this shit! All this shit! And a muthafucka can’t even get a job! Chris Tucker/ Dead Presidents!
south median	Most people comenting in here are poor with small mindset 😂🤷‍♂️ the guy who will buy this house probably have no time coment on this video 😂 he's probably sipping a glass of worlds most expensive Champaign on a 200m yatch somewhere in the mediterranean.
Ninja Please	Perhaps Trump could put you guys in touch with Dmitry Rybolovlev. He doesn’t seem to mind overpaying for real estate.

Wiicubemaster	I dont really like it. It doesnt seem like a house. It seems like an exhibit. Not somewhere to build and maintain your life.
Brian Park	Welcome to Barcelona Pavillion on crack part 1
3RT	If I had billions I would buy it then sell it for scrap and plant a small forest for nature to live in.
VriendP1	188 million, imagine the good you could do with that, instead of wasting it on your overinflated ego.
Voxxi	Dan Bilzerian's house right?
marzbite miso soup	looks cheap
Hongkai Lin	Imagine the tax he have to paid
CcelordeChristopher Chin	Nice, but too much glass
TensaiFFS	That house and all the installations are beautiful IMO, but i'd argue noone in the market for buying it feels the same way.   Anyone dropping $200M on personal real-estate like that is probably in their 40s - 70s and retiring. You're either a multi multi billionaire or not hungry anymore if you drop $200M on one personal property like that. There's not many young "hip" multi billionaires out there wanting to retire, even fewer fawning over Louis Vuitton art pieces. The kind of person to retire early is the kind of person who would never become a billionaire in the first place
Trey Strasser	This is one of those extraordinarily expensive items or places but this is the only one I think is worth it for the money
Super Cow	This is some gta type shit here
Nicholas Symons	Dan Bilzerians house
Braiytryene Gibbons	Lol and  I feel bad for spending extra money on food and these people spending millions on staircases
Marino 901	I just have this question hopefully someone can help sharing their opinion   If we were all billioners do you guys think this would be a different world than the one currently we live in ?
Danger	bathrooms are all for the ladies who come over not many bedrooms cause u bang in all 12
Shawn Marino	Going up in value? That’s why it decreased $62 million dollars from last year?
Yensi Martinez	Walk-in-closet 3 times bigger than my apt. With the cost of the master bath, i  finish my house overseas. For this home the forgot to add walkie talkies.

yashty100	idk wtf I'd do with a house like that I literally just stay in bed all day. -.-
Erica Davis	It’s beautiful but all I keep thinking is that I could buy 188 houses that are valued at $1Million a piece.  I could buy a house in 188 different places around the world!
Jon Cell	21 restrooms wtf
Sean F	The market for this house is maybe a few thousand people who could afford it.  I highly doubt he will get anywhere near the asking price.  After 2 years on the market, price is reduced from 250M to  188M, and it should be obvious it will have to go down even more.  I would be surprised if he got over 100M, probably 50M tops.  Check 630 Nimes road, in the same area, and that house only sold     for around 50M, 38K sq foot on 2 ares with a view.
zaggin	Where's Dan Bilzarian's stuff??
A H	(just a fyi... it's Dan Bilzerian's house...)
Ace Freely	Turd house in a turd state. Well at least the south side is a turd. Bet you can fit allot of so called “refugees” in a house that size. Load em up and pack em in California. Your a sanctuary state dump. Your own ignorance and PC  liberalism will consume itself. Democrats created a state where Lamborghini’s drive through homeless people’s feces. Great policies you fkn retards. And the solution your elected politicians think is the answers is more taxes LMAO!!  Flood more people into your welfare state, drive tax payers out all while giving high government positions pay wage increases. A fkn 5 year old has a better understanding of math than these wretched identity politic imbeciles. For the voters that keep voting democrat because CNN has you outraged over some bullshit. You did this to ur selves. Hello from Canada.

fastr1337	Anyone that even considers buying something this gaudy and pretentious is someone that only has "friends", not friends.
Clone_Army Official	Some things overpriced. 4 million dollar bugatti was off....Maybe 2 mil...top.
Sjoerd Siemes	I don't get why expensive homes always have to be so tasteless, all the white and shiny materials. It just looks cheap to me. Would never spend 188milion on this house, even if i had a billion.
Chill Hill	Can i say it too?    INSANE 😳
Uzair Ahmed	This house for peasants, disgusting      Jk I'm joking, this house is godly

Moodman002	God Bless, I love that house!! If I had a spare 188 Mill sitting in the bank I would be chillin in that Dolby.Atmos Theater room.
Sal Vong	May weather buy this house bro
smilyle	It doesn't have a music studio....lol
thoughtank101	I am not religious, but i am not very materialistic, i am much more practical. I value things according to what i can do with it, so a $300,000 sink, isn't worth more than a $50.00 sink to me. I would prefer a $3000 computer instead. If i had the choice between that two, i would obviously take the sink, so i can sell it and get 10 or 1 awesome computer, lol. Most of the things in this house are just glorified specimens, that other, much cheaper items can perform like wise, this is really an investment home for some filthy rich person, due to the material used.
Jose Lopez Diaz	Most ppl in the comments saying they wouldn’t buy this house bc its not nice enough... y’all know damn well you can’t even afford a sculpture in that house. Stupid. Would be hella happy to even get one of the cars that comes with the house
Fabian President	They can sell it to Floyd Mayweather

V. Will	"Thats Insane" or "Thats Crazy"....& You too can host this show!
floyd Donn	I personally would change some things and yeah some things are ridiculous in this home  , but I suppose that's part of the fun of having boat loads of money, you can create and get whatever you want otherwise what's the point in have Billions? you buy a home like this to ENTERTAIN ; and just because "YOU CAN" ..not because you need all the space or all the things inside, that's one of the differences in mindset between an average home buyer and a BILLIONAIRE, one man's trash is another man's treasure who can truly say what is and isn't art, although i admit some valuable art looks like a 5 year old did it lol , but just because i don't like it doesn't mean it's not art; when you have money like this you don't stay in one place for long why would you? this home seems more like a valuable trophy case of collectibles and unique design, it's not meant to be cozy
Ruben Soto	It's alright
Diego Grigorescu	this is the house dan bilzerian needs insane partires crazy bitches xd
Pookybear !	How can you expect anyone to pay attention when Beyonce is playing that loud? I'm genuinely wondering lol. Great bid BTW.

Shade Zero	Bill gates wipes his ass with 188 mill....
Habib Ba	If you read Rich Dad Poor Dad from Robert Kiyosaki, you’ll understand that this home is a liability, it cost you money , a lot of money .. and that’s why people do not know the difference between an asset and a liability
wallkillricky	Anyone know the name of the last song? Really bothering me and can’t find it.
Billy Cordero	First all I don't have 40 friends but owning this resort estate will do
Shane Suss	pick a new adjective bud
Aaron K	When this home was first built it came on the market for $250 million, clearly they are getting desperate. Dropped the price by $62 million. I’m sure if no one buys it in another year it will go down another $50 mill....  In 10 years it should be in my price range 🤔😂

Rob Anderson	Am I the only one who thinks the contemporary sculptures based on high end retail fashion are a bit vacant and overstated for a house that costs a quarter billion? They would look better in lobby for a Fortune 500. If you own the most expensive house you don’t need to show your rich.
MrMaus	actually.. this house costs 250000000$
dipankar barooah	i would buy this house instantely if i would have got the cash with me

a98cr125	Ryan,  I have to admit I am a little shocked you went to video one of the most expensive homes in the U.S. and yet failed to mic the person with you and had no video stabilization.   :-/    You need better video always, in all ways.......
Blueoptic	I saw nothing in this video that represented crazy. A 2 million dollar house in BC is 100x cooler then this.

CRM6718	@4:42 I only came here because someone told me that Max Hazan's bike is in this house....it sure is!!! cool!
Uber Adventures	It's dumb, the house itself is worth 30-40 million then you add a car collection, helicopter, and a bunch of rediculus adds that arn't "real property"...
SkrtandPlay	just need 188 mill
possiblychinesefilms	Remember when this house used to be 250 million dollars but they couldn't sell it so they discounted the price by 62 million dollars? Yeah. Still not going to sell at this price lol.

Mike Calhoun	I would be terrified to live in a house that gigantic. I would constantly be losing things, checking for intruders, getting lost, and I would be paranoid as hell. No thank you!
LIGER ZERO	It's cool, bout the actual value of it is probably 1/10th of it's asking price (not including the location)  for 188 million you could do much better.  Google ''32 million dollar house with waterpark'' for an example.
ultravish	The fact that it hasn't been sold yet after all this time and they have dropped the price shows just how overpriced this house actually is
RoseCo	But...its ugly
Eleven	Despite all the scenery, engineering, architecture and some of that that tacky art. It feels cold and hollow as I watch them tour the place. Big empty mansion that will be filled with many big empty souls. I can imagine the plastic women of hollywood that will fill this place along with the harvey weinsteins of hollywood.
Victor Lustig	0:08 Got it, perfect! yeah except that it can't fly above LA

TheWitness	if you can afford a house that has more bathrooms than bedrooms, give me a call and ill give you my bank account info so i can go not be poor anymore...

Sayan Biswas	Originally house's MSP was 250 millions but now it has reduced to 188 millions. It's obvious money doesn't grown on trees it has to be earned. Billionaires are not fools to spend 188 millions on a single house just wait for it price will drop even further.

Chris D'oulmeth	Anyone with this kind of money is going to wanna design and decorate the house themselves. At least I would.
Megan Claire	this is CRAZY
Scott Sophia	There are a number of misleading sales statements made at the beginning of this video. 1. Yacht depreciation is nowhere near the level mentioned. 2. On a home you have to pay property taxes each year, whereas you don’t have this expense on a yacht each year. California property taxes are much lower than the rest of the country, but depending upon the assessed value, it could still be lofty sum. 3. You will have much higher operating costs on a yacht, but the expenses to maintain a house like this will be quite high as well. 4. With all of these maintenance and annual expenses, the performance of real estate shouldn’t be compared to investing in the stock market, not to mention that unloading an asset like a house that lists for over $150 million will most likely take quite some time, and these types of homes usually sell for well below list price, and you will still have to pay capital gains tax, assuming you made money off the sale. 4. The values stated for a lot of the items are vastly overinflated. That’s not a $4 million dollar Bugatti.   I could continue, but you get the point. Always be skeptical of what someone says when they are trying to sell you something. Especially if it’s something of this level of magnitude.
CLOSE1 Rocket League	These mansions are crazy but 22 bathrooms is really not needed... even those celebs with crazy houses get lost in them.. don't use most rooms..  so I don't get it

NumberOneZero 0	Just a place for Russian oligarchs to dump their ill-gotten gains.
Batooony	Ridiculous, not in a good way.
Arfath Khalid	Adopt me Bald man!!!
Dee Loc	That's just a house that includes a bunch of expensive bullshit like those lv stones
Bruno Melo-Manning	From 250 million to 188? Went down quick!!😂
Tooth Beaver	If I win mega millions I'm buying this house
1 2	Nice house and all...but that same house on my lake here in MN would be around 10 million. You couldn't pay me enough to live in that area of California.
SC CUBA	100 million right now.
H&P Customs	To bad it’s in California, that state is a absolute shithole.
meghesh chonkar	It doesn't look that good  When you watch it in 144p
Narongrit Pissara	I do not stupid bye this house    I should bye another house  like 20 , 50 million dollars h best more than this house   💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Don't open my profile	He said 8th wonder of the world, Bro please look at our businessman mukesh ambani sir's home "Antillia" - 1.4b dollor home , most expensive real estate in the world.
Nicky Pan	Not a problem let me win the 1.7 billion mega million and I’ll buy it
Christian Calderon	188 million house , and does not has an ocean view.  I passed
Lingesh 27	This is nothing compare to Antilia.... Probably world's most expensive private house..
John James	For some reason, this feels like a luxurious prison. If I were that rich, and comitted a crime, and sentenced for a house arrest for years, then this is gonna be my house. NO ONE WANTS TO BUY THIS PROPERTY. It's been on the market for the longest time. It's overpriced, and lot is occupied wall to wall hence feels like a prison. At least a real prison has a yard. For $188M you're literally elbow to elbow with your neighbors. Whatever space you see in here is gonna be it. Can you even do a little fireworks during the holidays? I don't think so 'coz you don't have a yard, and there's a lot of restrictions in that area. Can you even do a children party with giant inflated stuff like slides etc? No, 'coz there's simply no space for it. Yes, helcopter is inlcuded. BUT you won't be bale to use it freely, simply because of restrictions in the area. It's NOT allowed, but you still can use it with a fine. What the hell. These is a bad joke.
GurbetHD	The video is about 188M mansion while the Ad tells about dying childs in Africa. Wow..
Arthur Saey	There is no universe in which this should be considered a 'home'. A whorehouse, sure, but not a home
Skyjuice70	This is when you have so much damn money, it makes you insane. All concept of need vs want goes right out the window.
SAMANYU OKADE	At least this house is WORTH this much... now let’s talk about $1.5B single family flat
Splat	Wonder how much just the plain house would be, without all of the expensive shit in it.
Deathbreather 200	How tf do people afford this?!?

Marcheur de Planète	Show-off house, very useless. Hyper rich get more stupid every year. And the previous owner (or the people who staged the house) have a very bad wine taste (Screaming Eagle and Ace of Spade do not worth the prices, period ! ) Another show-off. Poor people at the end. Show-off to exist, dumbest thing ever !!!

Xavier Tournaud	All right, very cool to see that tour, well done Ryan!  For me, this house is a mall has no charm whatsoever.  I would never buy a house like this, then again, who gives a rats ass since I don't have the money and probably never will.
Homer Simpson	Ok let's put 100 dolar each until we get the money to buy the house, to trow a party, after that we sell it and get our 100 dolares back
Brazy Cinco	Isn't this the same mansion developed by Bruce Makowski going for $250m last year? Things didn't go according to plan huh
Calvin Tai	The architecture is really exquisite, but there’s just somethings you don’t really need.

L Jackson	i thought this mansion was selling for $250M. what happened?
Chi - RaQ	$188M ? Foh!  You can’t take this house in your grave. If I had money like that I would NEVER buy this house since we are in this world for temporary time. I’ll design my own house from ground up and give majority of the money to charity. $188M can help so many poor people out there who is dying from starvation and also provide roof on there heads. Fuck this corrupted ass world!
Alejandro Diaz	Crazy
Mr Peace	The person buying this, will definitely be asking about torture chamber! Keep that in mind Mr seller!

Warto wwaters	“Crazy”
Abusequalsintake	if Bob Guccione had been a emotionally withholding dilantin addict.  The space jumps deftly between wonderful and horrible.
Rob Waring	So disappointing they would fill this house with such rubbish. No elegance. No refinement just showy glitzy crap. Nice cars and movie theatre though.
Wanzi tv	Last year this same expensive for no reason house was foing for 250mill https://youtu.be/fUdJdG5cpYw Ill wait 6yrs and pay 500k for it😂

hakjie11	People who could afford this house don't want to live in this kind of house. They want privacy and silence. This is good for rapper mv only.
sylheti123	People are dying of hunger everyday the in equality in the world is disgusting these people are looking at a 3000k sink while people are dying of starvation makes me sick 😡

Jeffry Dalisay	That's insanely crazy awesome!  👍😁
Omar Ahmed A-omar	C A P I T A L I S M
Niles	The saddest thing with these billionaires that you don't have 40 close friends. You have people that pretend to like you to part of the fun and your staff. Many billionaires live in isolation because they're never in one place long enough to actually become part of the community.
andrew schulte	I'm not spending that unless I can shit once a day for an entire month without using the same toilet twice. This is unacceptable
Kevin Foo	House with NO Human relationship
nope datt	"Crazy".....  "Insane".....   Is it?
Z4ch Stro0	Sorry but even if I had that much money this place is more of a money pit than an investment. How are you making money off this investment? Rent it out?
Nelson Lencina	That’s crazy..
Anders Svensson	"So you're watching Superbowl with 40 of our closest friends" Bwhahaha! This is the most american video I've ever seen. I truly wish I had that amount of cash to blow on whatever, but honestly, most of the furnishing comes off as tacky, even if he proclaims it's "art" (lul). Who in their right mind would pay for this house?
Ged0	Dan bilzarian bought this house or rented i dont know :D he lives there.
Ben C	After watching this all I can think about is how much it would hurt when I stub my toe on that staircase.  Also my cats, running full speed up it only to have there back legs peel out :)
Steve Jones	what the realtor fails to point out is the boat owner pays no tax if he's smart, so his boat will pay for itself in 5 years regardless of depreciation, property is subject to tax at both ends, purchase and sale !!
ItsJad	who cares
Kevin in Paradise	Interesting place. Thanks for sharing.
hawkeye1680	That’s insane. Crazy.
matthias michel	So that stupid sink costs more then my appartment ... Twice 😂
Christopher Primm	This house is stupid big. What the hell are you gonna do with all the space? Have parties and friends over 24/7? Houses like this are stupid. Who wants to spend 188 million on that? Average people don’t come anywhere near that kind of money. I bet rent is some dumb shit like 5 million a month.
Happy Dappy	That house used to be 250mill. Seems like not really good investment...huh?
Got Damn	If i hit the mega millions I'm COPPING lol
Abhiram Tirumala	0:42 RIP Paul Allen

Loawercs31	If you have way too much money, this is the place for you. Imagine the sales commission the realtor will get.
Demolition playa	9:30. I would play BO4 on that tbh
Bobbythefish_gaming	How could you live in something like this and call it a house like wtf
Alhassan Omar	I will buy one when i get a job inshaalah
Dude PANDA!!!	Imagine playing games on that tv
Clocky	that was insane ! !!
Heasley252	Nothing about it feels "Homely" and you can't buy that homely feeling it's priceless. This house for all it is, feels so cold and lonely and I personally would hate to live in it.
null	A house that stands out in that area really has to be something special. Literally surrounded by 50mil+ homes.
B Natty	The only thing I can come up with after watching this house tour is what a waste!!
karim hari	i have exactly 3 euro in my pocket thats it . I have no money in the bank and i have to watch this shit just to make myself more productive and go out there to look for a job maybe one day i will by this house inshallah
Mike Smith	I don't the fake rappers can afford to rent this place for their fake rap videos.
Trip Fifteen	I would want to live alone in that house I would kick everyone out lmao ITS MINE!!!! The only ppl I would have is the gate guards n a house keeper
Oscar Villegas	Dan Bilzerian is staying there now. Not sure if he bought it or if hes just renting it.
Anton Olm	I guess they couldn't sell it for 250 million
Max Standen	I thought Dan Bilzerian was living here now?

Awais Ali	Why didn't you mic the gentleman
I Luv 2 Screw	I will sue.   Why is my home on YouTube?. Plz remove!
ChrisCo	That guy knew his stuff!! Wow
Tito ;7	Looks like a cartel bosses house
TheHumbleBeliever	How about you spend all this money to feed poor people in Africa and appease 188 million people's hunger in the world! You think you won't be judged for all the wealth Allah gave you? Why are you spending all this wealth lavishly while 100 million people dying of starvation every year?
heladar	And this is why at some point, a devastating war or the enslavement of the (working) poor will be unavoidable. Such a wealth disparity is sickening. This is not luxury, this is just obscene. But as in many other cases, it takes an outsider to get that perspective. Once you are absorbed in that kind of lifestyle, you wont come out of your bubble.
R R Borooah	It is tacky. The effort put into building it is appreciable. But it is mostly glitzy .
Malayaj Panda	Go to the worlds most expenshiv house antilia plz bro mail me plzzzzzzzzz

Black Collar Network	Just on YouTube looking for what to do when i hit the megamillions
Phil C	I will never have that kind of money but if I did I wouldn't waste on 90% of what was shown.
Toby Levins	Yes, but is it insane?
ouchiko2	It's too personal, there's nothing left to think about.  For £188m I'd prefer to buy the land and make something myself.  This is more like a hotel.
Boricua Alma	Such insane prices & costs... $350 Million, $250 Million, $188 Million... NOTHING ON THIS PLANET SHOULD COST THAT MUCH MONEY! humans are insane! my home is state of the art, automated, modern/contemporary built in 2014, I bought my own lot and designed my home along with the architect for that builder, I have an in ground pool, a hot tub, a sauna, a lower level movie theater, wine room, rec/billiards room, granite & marble etc..etc.. I even have an indoor waterfall/rock formation that flows into a koi pond (which I didn't see in this $188 Million dollar home) and my cousin and my sister helped me to do it (I saw it on a you tube video and I wanted my own version of it) my lot cost me $85K for 1.8 Acres and my home is 3,600 sq.ft. with a 1,200 sq.ft. Lower level and my home cost $750K (so including the lot & some other things) = $850k total... I have 4 bd.rms 2 full bathrooms & 2 half baths (there's a master bath, and a main bathroom, a half bath on the first floor and another half bath in the lower level) and all of my bedrooms are on the second floor (I'm not a fan of first floor master bedrooms) and I have gorgeous natural views of the metroparks in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio... (I'm a realtor & I flip houses in case people want to know what I do for a living to be able to afford to have my own home built) and at 32! I consider it a major accomplishment and I did it all for LESS THAN $1 MILLION dollars (my home is gorgeous and I love it!) and then I see THIS! for $188 MILLION! WOW!!!... this house is worth MAYBE $50 MILLION! (at the most!) AND THAT'S INCLUDING ALL THE FURNITURE & DECOR! (minus the helicopter)... it's a nice house, but much like everything else in California (and NYC) it's WAY OVERPRICED! I'm just saying...
iCreezy	2 million dollar stairs.... excuse me... what the .... fuck
Mohit M-2	This whole house was completely featured in a remix music video (ride it). That video was removed last month from YouTube,,, I think they r having trouble selling this house,,, they are trying to do as much they can
Ken Soraya	It will double in 10 - 12 years... so if you put $70M down, in 10 years you will make $300Million Gross ..  assuming you can pay 500K monthly mortgage and $125K Misc monthly expenses for 120 months....  So at the end of 10 years you can possibly net $150M... Plus all the yearly tax advantages..
Harin Hasindha	I'm having the biggest hard on of my whole life.
CREATION	Build that in south and it’ll be $488,000
Michael Georgiou	Besides the limited vocabulary of Ryan, has anybody else noticed that there is a typo in the description? It's insane and crazy I know.
HOLO	Its price is dropping rapidly
Supreet Kadam	Have seen this house in too many videos now. What's the matter? Isn't it selling?
maxyeap	What you're not looking at is the amount of slave labour that is produced to enable someone to be so rich. This is greedy and evil to the core.
sircivicirl	Take all the art and champagne out the house is only worth about 2 million
True Trees	Bored 😕
THE VICEAHMED	Oh they mean Bruce Wayne now it makes sense of course he can afford it
lawfreefly	What a Fail.  At 2:55 there is a promo for the place at 250 mil.  and now it is 188, so much for the Devil's....(er sorry Brett) Platinum Triangle.  Plus Bruce's custom artsy Fartsy stuff  likely appeals to fans  of true gouache.  $80,000 anchor, 2 million dollar staircase that  is cool but done by no one significant, it is not like it is a Calder Staircase, or a Corbusier staircase, or even a Saarinen staircase.   I am sure landing the copter on that small pinnacle is a bitch with high winds.  The wine display was cool and so were the closets but easily attainable for any upscale contemporary home.  All of this custom crap and he is dumping it, so much for an appreciation of his own creation.  I bet Pron sounds real good in the home theater.
Peter Mwandia	@188M? That shit gonna be there forever. Nobody buying a house worth $188m.
YerA5s	This house has lost some value.
abdullah kozan	You go to a mansion from millions, and cant a better camera
life is useless	not sure if real house or district mall
deepblue1776	This flipper is gonna lose big time if he can't find a buyer soon. Well, I'd be interested if the asking price is around $88 million, and I wouldn't mind to let them remove all those museum junks to further drop the price to around $50 mil.
Feldt HD	who is bruce
whiterhino31	Guess the housing market is coming down now this house is selling for $188 Million.   Way down from the $250 million that it was going for ( also seen at 2:54 in video).   At that rate I can wait another 50-100 years maybe I can get a loan and consider it.  :-)
msmoorad123	a waste of money.  not even extravagant- just stupid.
Keith Roberts	Is it on the market? If so, why!
The Blitz	It was too expensive that they reduced the price by 60 million dollars damn!!!
David Young	4 million dollar PAGANI?! HAHAHA fuck off
AnotherSKYWALKR	We get it, “That’s crazy!”
Burn the world	That is not a home. That is a business HQ you can live in and temporarily house a team. These are the types of houses celebrities, VIPs, and corporate officers stay in while visiting. They are also used to host private parties for the same people. I doubt anyone actually lives there full time.
Gray Cloud	This guy keeps saying "insane" and "crazy". Yeah it is but don't be a tool
maisie	"40 of your closest friends", yeah sure
Eric p	Isn’t that dan blazerian house?
Moonchild 3-3-3	But how about building one on a 200 acre or some shit like that and still have money to blow I mean shit
Dirty West	So money doesn't really buy you taste does it?
senor360	Amazing house, but in the future could you also mic the other person that is in the video? There are several times where his voice is very low. Thx for showing 99.9% of us what we cannot afford. :)
Dave C.	Amazing house...but man..it feels so cold.  Even if I could afford that, I wouldn't want it.  I'd want a big house with intimate places that feel warm.  All that glass, steel and rock feels like it is without soul. All those toys on display?  What a waste.  Go ride and drive them!
awenindoe	With this kind of money, I'd buy a couple hundred acres of rainforest, build a small house in the heart of it, get satellite internet, hire a few locals as staff, and live the rest of my life out in utter isolation. Not to say keep the rainforest safe.

Mizhan Adhikary	Wasn't this house 250 million before
Nico	Im sorry, this is an impressive house but only an idiot would buy this. "You can watch this with 40 of your CLOSEST friends"?? Who even has 40 actual friends? Also this house is just for status and is way too big to live in. Probably thats why no one is buy it.
cedric Dobré	Im sitting here thinking of how  the fuck paying my rent this month and YouTube recommended me that?? Thanks youtube
Max D	Gaudy, ostentatious, and mostly just heinous. Wouldn't pay $1 million for that hideous place. Just wish I could smash all those marble turds that they call art.

Gonzalo	I would buy myself a house for my family, a house and money to my grandparents, and houses for my cousins with that kind of money. I wouldn't buy a house like that especially with that price tag. Including all those pointless $1mill "art" decorations.
The Nanja	But does it come with an IT guy????
Nurweilichschwarzbin	Glauben sie das ich Verrückt bin? Diese Frage stellte mir Elon Musk nach einem langen Abend...
Arma Lol	GTA 6 look so real
Jasper Cooper	This is so sad :(  looks like an Airport lounge and duty free shop. Gosh it must be so boring to assess all your belongings by its price.
Sunnewer Toolow	So the value of this can't go down?   Funny how the 250 million dollar estate is now being offered for 188 million. Why is that, huh?
Sir Maggotbone	this is sickening.
daftboy11	I've read about this house. The helicopter comes with the house but it's non-functional.
David Watkins	So it didn't sell for $250,000,000 as I see on the poster & it's now $188,000,000....?.
Boabywankenobi	The sales guy seems a decent guy eh.
Brutal1ty	Just crazy.
TheG352004	I have the same house in my GTA V  :D
Team 974	On his gravestone they’ll engrave. “Insane and Crazy.”
David smallwood	Must be the greatest monument to bad taste I have yet seen. You would know everything you need to know about the person who buys this before you meet them.
26 Machine	now the one who build is richer than the owner
Mike Hog A Nator	If I win the billion dollar mega lottery I’ll buy it!! Not!

oscar bouwman	"that was insane"
Majd Qudah	The price of the house has dropped from 250mill to 188 in less than a year, next year will be 150 or less than that lol
YAMZA 8	lmao, merryweather comes with the deal?
Kuda Makoni	Excuse me, what am i buying again?
ABHISHEK VERMA	188 million $ for this masterclass beauty... So how Mukesh Ambani's Antilla in Mumbai wud be from inside, which costed whopping 1 billion $.
Sam TuBer	It said 250 mil on the board and the title says 188. Is it a real estate thing or no one has shown interest in this overdone house
DJ ENRO	For me as an architect its not understandable ! Just a simple house with expensive materials and art init !
David Thomason	A lot of useless stuff, i would sell all the art
Frankii s.	m8 I would rather spend 188m on a 3-5m home and invest some on stocks and crypto and spend a little bit more on clothing and shoes and good food and video games like bruh that would be my dream I don't really care for a 188m home... sure tho its nice for those who do have that kind of money
R	So this house was $250 million but now it’s $188 million. That’s a crazy big drop!
Blair Ambrose	the other guy is doing a hard sell he knows the price of everything and the value of nothing,  250million for a house on one acre you are having a laugh
joseph contreras	The room came with girls that’s why they didn’t want to show lol
johnny j	Nice house but too many buts, a lot of technology witch about 10 - 15 years is like from the last century, style/design same story,  my opinion very hard sell,  in the beginning he tried some investment advice, happy that he didn't go too deep on that. In my opinion with big mansions, you are always safer with Mediterranean style building, it has been very desirable, and I think it will stay desirable next 100 years coming.
heyjude2109	The price went down from $250,000,000 to $188,000,000 in less than a few years remaining empty.  I contacted the developer to find out what the price was, that was like a year and a half ago.
Myrone Moyo	I love luxury listings...  This house right here.... OMF
Antony Taggart	Does the chopper come included? $188 million ...... I'd expect a couple of F-35 (vertical takeoff version) and a batcave.
Unity Walks	To think that Gates can buy like hundreds of these without even thinking about it
Emma Lambert	From $250 million to $188 million the price is dropping 😁
Mistic Gamer	Notch prob has a minecraft mega lan party at at his house(this house)

VineApple	He got a 188 million dollars housr but he cant afford an iphone x?
Edwin Pang	Insane
Sameer Singh	America! Living the dream.
OverkilledUnderdog	For $188M I expected it to be ocean front views etc. Also, it just doesn't feel like home. It just looks like a lavish resort complex. Nothing felt homely. Sorry.
Timotej Cerne	Wasn't this house selling for 250M?
P 4	That’s the most one expensive in the world.
uncle_gazpacho	"helicopter comes with it?" "yep" "got it. perfect".  cringe level over 9000

Lenad Johnson	Here Ryan kinda reminds me of those video game characters  programmed to say the same phrases over and over... "insane.. what just happened.. insane.. what just...."  I think your better off leading the house tour based on your other videos.
Harry Hog	That sink costs more than my house
Mc Tam	dude, he haven't count on the housing tax that come with it each year
Pranjal Kumar	This used to be 250 million dollars xD
Monisha Daryanani	Awesome! Love you Ryan and the work you do. Love this home . May I please suggest to drop the huge subtitles ... it's blocking the view of the home in very crucial parts .. like the black marble stone bathroom :) I say this kindly.  I want the home by the way . Warm regards from Hong Kong !
StormzYLive	Ok so I’m 15 and I live in a 50mil mansion with my parents,that’s fine but 188mil and 21 bathrooms with 38ksqft wtf are you gonna do with all that

BaseGodEric	The funny thing is this same house I just saw on a video was being sold for 250 million 😂
white g	Ring bill gates
Snapbomb !!	I like the way beyonceys music is playin in the background
Yes, I Work Hard.	Wayyy overpriced and niche driven. Google what else you can get for this price and you'll see what im talking about. I'm guessing only new money would purchase something like this, aka lottery winners.
K3rm1t	odd flex but ok
Team Unfair Bear	this has house got written overkill all over the place.
Martin Scerri	obviously having trouble selling, was 250mil a year ago
Themiya Adikari	Dats crazy dats insane dats crazy dats insane dats.......😂

FrozenEternity	Its actually kind of disgusting how much Nothing money can buy you. I mean parts of this house was nice but gees a lot of it wasn't
gregory panagiotopoulos	Expensive suits I guess don’t have pockets. His phone was in his hand the entire time
Wraith Tymo	Anyone wanna loan me 188 million?
David Chen	RIP Paul Allen
david Twer	"That's insane, that's insane" calm down and learn to meditate dude instead of walking around talking like a parrot
jackchickenwing	disgusting consumption
Jason Pao	The price tag is meant to attract a possible Chinese buyer but the biggest mistake is to have a four in the address as the 4 mean death.  Should have been an 8 or even a 6.  I am not even sure if the property complies with feng shui principles as it is probably an odd lot.
perfectly imperfect	This house seems worth it and if I had the money I would buy it😅
Josh Delacy	188 million advertised but realistically 250 million 😂😂
Elmario Mara	The owner loves Beyonce
Stephen Singletary	Insane.....Nuts.....That's crazy

Benjithemin	Lol you can buy a nice house for the price of the sink
Maya Ritter	Take a shot everytime Ryan says "Crazy" and "Insane"
George Stenos	This guy looks like Tom  Cruise without his hair.
Salmonfaky	Beyonce sucks.
Sebastian Brunberg	Isn't this the house of Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft?
ash faq	and here i'm struggling for 12000$ to pay my tuition fees!
DjangoUnbound	The price drops to under 100 if you subtract the value of all of items that come with the house, like the helicopter, which alone is probably 30 million
Sir Douglas Howel, 5th Seat	I feel like the person who owns this has anything and still feels empty inside
Cardox Pinksauce	that house was initially offered at 250 million! i guess nobody wants to buy it!
EdVentures	Wow. Wow. Wow.

Uniform Health	https://youtu.be/fUdJdG5cpYw  https://youtu.be/BzEp2YB7nOU  price seems to be falling tho with so many extras it’s hard to say what is being included the first one is what it could have been if they went on.
K Linn	if i hit mega million  i gonna buy this mansion LOL
50 Pence	Snake oil
Smuffs Smuffs	All that money spent and you still have to snort cocaine out of a rolled up $100 bill.
EddyGraphic	This house is not that special, I've seen way cheaper ones that look better and have more useful stuff, this one is full of unnecessary luxury items made by big brands.
Raju Venkat	Insane... That is crazy
John Manley	You’ll never get a permit to land a helicopter there. The owner/developer has cheesy taste. The price has dropped from 250 already, and will likely need to drop a lot more. It’s a dog of an investment.
Kotey Neequaye	Love your voice.
delatroy	So many overpriced gimmicks
Felipe Quizena	Insane 🙄
Nehladdy Hawi	I think those LV chests are tacky.  They tried too hard be over top.

DEERY PRODUCTIONS	Is this guy a robot
Thom	Money no object, I'd still rather not have a house that looks like an airport/hotel.
Fiddles Worth	"insane"
Mriz basnet	250 to 188. well i think this house is waiting for me, i will buy one day. i will come back here and reply to this comment in the future
Samahaha	Here's a list of Ryan's best reactions: "In-sane. Right. Nuts. Completely Crazy.  That's insane. That's INsane. Right. Wow. Nuts. Crazy. What just happened? That's insane. Insane. That's awesome. Crazy. What? That's Crayzee. Sure. In-sane. Wow. That's Crayzee. Bonkers. That's Crazy. What just happened, That was insane."  - Ryan Serhant
David Will	This place has been on the market for several years. As I recall it first listed at 250M.
Min H. OO	Crazy.
sam burke	Hard pass... NEXT!
De Ba	Wreaks obnoxious EGO times a million. Tell us about “Bruce’s” philanthropy efforts. Sean tells the story of this place, by “this is the best in the world”.... “this cost ______....... that cost_______”.........”it’s a one of a kind”...... next.
Sebas M	So if you take away the “cool” things the price is around 25 million. I rather get a mansion in a cheaper state than California
batangisip89	sure
fishwish pishpish	5:50 oh, you’re with her now?
Matt Kelly	There is a 25 million dollar mansion being build kind of close by, and it looks like the most elegant and fancy house of all time to me. I cant see how 155million would be any better to spend at that point lol
Hugo Cervantes	This is Dan Bilzerian’s house
E I N S	Retarded.... of course it costs that much when it has a stair case that is worth 1 million, everything there is overpriced especially made for billionaires, a normal staircase = 50 000 , with some silver shit on it = 1 million.  For that kind of cash that house is not practical at all. With that kind of money I would just rather have a smaller house but a lot of land.
friesbeofreguys14	I feel like this is one of Tony Stark's houses....
Ruslan Davudov	I really wanna release a massive fart in that house.
MrKernkraft4000	"What just happened"  What I said an unrealistic number of times up until the moment that was stated.
Raibin Zamuar	wait a minutes, few years ago i watch a video about a house priced $250 M, I think this is the same house.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8teHLSIdLqM yeah it is, so Price down because nobody buy it?
George Brown	I love how Beyoncé is playing in the background! C’mon beehive!
Urias Davis	Clicked for the tour. Stayed for Beyonce.
Munraj Gill	End any convo saying I have a $250,000 sink
Destroy Idiots	Just replace the word insane with stupid and bam you got my commentary.
Difference Engine (DE)	“Wow” “Crazy” “Insane” - Ryan Serhant
JAMES JONES	What a waste! Who needs a stupid giant camera sitting in their house! Do people really care about a polished steel staircase?🙄   And who’s this clown with the limited vocabulary, all he knows is “crazy” and “insane”!
TiP121PP	When the People start getting sick of the Rich Mans Greed, taking more than they need, at the average persons expense, this house will go up in flames. I bet you the owner has a $30 million dollar bunker for such an occasion! A global civil war is on the brink, because of greed like this. They make a 1 billion, they want 2 more, it's never enough and the only way make more at a faster rate, is to find new ways to screw over the the little guy.THAT MEANS YOU!  This perpetual money making drive, similar to Corporations, will force societies to collapse.
karasuu	$188mil, did they hire a 12 year old to design this house and pay them $20? Everything is so out of place and that staircase is hideous.
Skumpaj	Looks like a mall, LOOOOL
yankeesuperstar	I had to sub now.
dus hdhs	Even if i had the money, i wouldn't buy this much unnecessary space
William Cannon	bruh that coffee machine room is bigger than mine
HI-FI LUGGAGE	When Ryan's first child was born he was like, "Right. Insane. That's awesome. Sure. Bonkers." Another monosyllabic man.
Colton Davie	Rip Paul Allen :(
Nick Schwab	RIP Paul Allan
Luca Zaidan	Screw the house... what about airwolf?! I’ll buy that please!
Robert Herman	California real estate is over rated👎
papa mito	Dude I'm always like why the fuck do you need 21 bathrooms and only 12 bedrooms? and why would you pay so much for a house but his marketing speech about the boats and houses really bought me over even though I know he did it to win over the clients hahaha.
Joonas Abokther	Sure. Insane. That’s crazy. Crazy insane.
Gimme Head	Yeah that crazy, yeah insane
Noel Lindberg	I thougt the House costs 250 Million Dollar oder videos on YouTube about this hous😂
Keith Hughes	Is it me or is that some people are just bored with too much money ?
ElmwoodParkHulk	That's not a house that's a resort / art museum
xJDZL	oh the dead animal skin is so gorgeous.
Jon Lynch	“Insane”... “Crazy”... “oh yeah, this staircase is about 2 million, that clock on the wall is one of a kind and worth 250k.” This is sad, and pathetic. Things won’t make you happy people. Love, real relationships and staying true to your values will.
Lance V	seems like gta5 mods
Intan Ananda	Imagine if u lost in this kind of home
TheOG llama21	That would be so lit with all your friends
Bill Buffett	It's the ugliest house in the world. It does not feel cozy, the interior designer did a bad job. $188M for that shit? No thanks.
cammy a	These inspire me to wake up and grind hard everyday

Caleb TV	Wow insane
Freddy Arancibia	I read somewhere that the helicopter is useless because one is not allowed to fly any aircraft in residential zone..  And that's CRAAAZY!! CRAAAY CRAAAY!!
Kamilo Gutierrez	And i Pay $1000 for one bedroom apartment
The Mongstradamous	You have me when you start off with Kasabian.
Casey Reeves	RYAN the fucking SAVAGE
Kunal Ketkar	So did the entire comment section just ignore the fact that there is a video on yt which was uploaded a year ago where the same house was for 250 mil and the owner/architect/builder was reluctant of selling it for not less than 250. Either he is a complete moron/delusional or reality struck him HARDDD...
kenny kennysson	ehhh....this complex has lost value since the first time the house was put out on sale it was originally retailed at about approx. $500.000.000 us dollars! This real estate agent aren't telling you the whole story behind.....
Roberto Contreras	I drive by that compound everyday. Thing is a beaut. Especially at night when it's all lit up.
Dillon Parente	I will be buying this house Tuesday night when I win the mega millions lotto that’s now at 1.6 billion dollars. Just watch. I got this.
The 3rd Option	Lots of trash and wasted space. No class. Hope no one feels envy. It’s being bored in comfort. Trust me, don’t feel less then you are.
T A R S	500$ is the best i can do
Jakob Bell	I know where I'm going during a zombie apocalypse
Edgy Brah	what song is playing around the 10:00 minute mark?
redraider38	Can you even take those vehicles out for a ride or do they just sit there forever?
Commentator 101	Waste of money. A new house is like a new car, its no longer a big deal after 6 months but the maintenace cost and property tax every year are a big deal. That property is more of a burden. Wouldnt care for it even if i was a billionaire.
VideoMasher3000	Jeff Bezos could purchase this. 265 times over. He could have over 265 copies of this exact house and still be the richest man in the world.
booji123	Lol I honestly would not want to live in this house.
Albus	this is the biggest waste of money you can spend on...
Rush380	Why did youtube recommend this video to me.....I live in my car.
Range Rover	i would order 100 hookers a night for a year and then be broke
chris7jakarta	I remember this 'house' for sale in january 2017 for $250 million incl. heli and car collection. Seems they can't get rid of it that easily. Those cereal/candy pipes @10:00, a 5 star hotel doesn't even have that much flavour and amount. The owner must be in showbusiness, this is way overdone.
Aydn Lunden	id never want this shit even if i had all the money in the world.
XXX	Jeff Bezos where u at?
Tilted Cowards	why is this in my recommended..
Pratama Putra Wijaya	The real price of the house is..      $.45.000.000   And thats still crazy amount of money..   Wheres the rest of the price go..???   Maybe the additional grass cost 1 million bucks ??     Who know..
Munna Bakchod	I am happy with my two room flat alot of happiness
Satvik Arora	Last year it was  priced at $250mil....now $188mil ?? Kind of starnge.
Jiany Star Massa vich	The more they speak the more I realize this is completely ridiculous loool.  + i'm here for the deserved funny comments!
JGdownunder	"wow" "crazy"  "bonkers"  "okay" "hah"
Daniel Cohen	Take a shot every time Ryan says "Insane."
Red Neck	can i trade this house with... my life?
theifofmemes	this prolly would be a few dozen less million if it wasn't California
Christopher Gaul	How in the heck did a guy who's entire vocabulary consists of "insane" and "crazy" get this job?! I want to apply for this job. I know at least a dozen other adjectives!
Shin Shark	Who owns the house if anyone does?
Adrian Mora	Too bad it was a rare shitty day. WTF?? #F*kJuneGloom! Blue  sky would have made it POP! Dope house regardless!
nesohawkins	Does it include all those cars?
One Oak Angel	Wow...
Harpoon IsMaroon	This is gonna be my house one day.
XXXXYYYXXXX	there's really no visual coherence
Kenneth James	This house has been on sale for a long time. I feel like I watched the video on this house last year. I think they may have went too far with this one.
DrewKnowProductions	Here’s a $2,000,000 staircase... “but hey you wanna something cool?” ...😂
Apple Car	honestly i would prefer living in a decked out van and have the freedom to travel the country than live in this house but that is just me i guess
Ja2808	And yet still be bored..
SCHONEY G	Guess i know what im buying when i win the mega millions jackpot
Dustin Recker	I wouldn’t even want 90% of the stuff in that house. The helicopter and the cars are all I want, the rest, kick it to the curb
TJ Jackson	Paul Allen's dead, bucko!
warlike tiger	now i know the reason of climate change
Tamara Pearson	The super rich are disgusting. $250,000 for a bathroom sink, or keep 20 families in a poor country alive for a year- they choose the sink.
ChaoticVlogs	Who lives there?!
Jim Edge	This is so homey... Like living in a mall...
Charles Hamilton	As long as there are Russian oligarchs desperate to get their money and families out of Russia or Middle Eastern billionaires who, just a generation ago saw their forebears living in squalor, there will be a market for homes like these. God, I love capitalism. Seriously, I do.
80z Baby	What a tard. He's showing you something and you play with the stuffed gator.
Gcal1956	Just the pay roll for the staff to care for this place is probably over 50-75k A MONTH!  maids, cooks, pilot , maintaining the place , etc etc.  then the physical trainer , the armed guards , and who ever else is there puts this place at 100k a month I bet. For just payroll.
Josephine Martin	This is one of the coolest houses you've toured yet!
Land Abroad	My cousins father in law owns a 100 billion dollar insurance company and has liquid assets of 500 million and lives in a 300 thousand dollar house! Place that in perspective for a truly and extremely wealthy person! A house with a price tag of hundreds of millions is simply and truly massive overkill!
KingCairo_PS4	Do yall take food stamps??
emericaman16	That's crazy  Insane  That's crazy  Insane
Duckman	2000 pound Chrome camera...  “ITs A oNe of OnE”          No shit.
I Tuurtley don't even care	I used to work for directv and i worked in the Hamptons in New York. That was my area, nearly drove me fucking crazy dealing with multi-million dollar homes, nearly every single one of their owners solve problems by throwing money at it. I believe about 80% were over 30-50 million dollar, and they range in all sizes concerning the land is worth millions alone. Dealing with ancient tv system, massive media centers with dozens and dozens of TV's, where they want everything conceal and perfect. They could have a slight delay on the remote and they'll call me asking about what I did wrong, the TV could be going all "snowy" on them and they could be yelling at me over the phone for not showing them how it works when most of the times they left their home manager deal with me.  That saying though, I worked on some really nice homes, it also made me feel very important because I worked alone and i worked very hard for them all the time(some of them still have my personal number and they call me sometimes, even though i quit 1 year ago). My biggest home was worth more than this guys house. It apparently cost him 195 million dollars and he pays half a Million in property taxes alone each year. I was their to fix the TV service of his private security force, they had watch towers and small pillar boxes of sorts all over the perimeter. The dish was located under a boardwalk to the beach and i told the guy it was impossible, I would never get it through my boss. I was dealing with a security guard and he said he could get anything done to fix it and I told him the one thing he couldn't do, PUT IT ON THE FUCKING ROOF.
Bryan D Dass	The strange guy saying 'sure' 'sure 'sure' 'crazy' 'crazy' 'crazy' 'insane' 'insane' damn man u a robot!
James Hughes	So this mega mansion used to cost $250mil. Now it's $188mil. Can you imagine when Black Friday hits? This could be a real bargain then. lol
T Man	One day I will own a house like that.
Jonathon	What i'm buying after I win the Mega Millions this week............ lmao
Ryan Carmona	Lol I hate California
Muddie Vlogs	It’s pretty darn cool “house” but, the price tag is just too much, even if u have the money 💰 kinda obscene way of spending your fortune.
Nate Stombaugh	Lol this idiot thinks that house is gonna be worth more in 10 years! Lmao no one is paying millions for over 7 bedrooms. Fucking retards making the housing market crash from inflation and vacant waste of space
Stoniii	Imagine loosing your 2 months old baby
Guy Michaely	That's a pretty nice house
Liam Wyatt	that sink is worth more than my entire family’s net worth
Joe On a Boat	i don't support this guy's opinion on boats
SavEli	Seems like a house Lucifer Morningstar would like to buy.
QAQ QAQ	it was asking 250mil someyears ago
d3tach3d	95% of that is just perceived value of the exotic materials and the shitty pretentious modern art
jmjosemora16	Anybody on here wondering what they could buy if they win the megamillions?
ed v	Anyone who is smart enough to have the money to buy this home isn't stupid enough to buy this home.
swong32	damn rich people really don't have good taste
Ruy Roberto	Who the F/%& is Bruce?
serofibrinous	Sure, Insane, Crazy- This is talent!
FGOM FamilyandGodOverMoney	This is way to much. I'd rather have me a nice million dollar crib somewhere near the beach. I want my kids, wife, and family happy! There are some people who could afford this house but I guarantee they didnt spend a lot of time with their kids and family, and that to me is being broke! Money isn't everything people trust me! Take care of your wife, kids, and family and you will be richer then these rich fucks!
The Legend	Nah. I won't take it , even for free
Haris Sakanovic	Won’t ever sell. The yearly cost of upkeep on this house is ridiculous

Cloud 9	So are you going to buy it or pretend to be a big baller?
johnlyn1	If it wasn't for the damn property tax I would buy it! I refuse to pay the State $3,652.14 PER DAY for the privilege of living in my own property. You pay $188 million and then have to pay the State $1,333,032 per year in extortion rent which is $3,652.14 per day, just to be able to keep your own property and live in it.
Carlile	i aspire to be there someday
sammich	major overkill
Guillaume Tremblay	The only absolutely unimpressive feature from this place is the cellar. Definitely not on par with the rest. When you have those kinds of means, your cellar must be at least more like a museum than a second thought shelf. It looks like a place more about the container than the content.
Paul R.	LA is wack...all hype
Roastt U	I assume he wont be liking the after life as much

Robert Metzel	Talk about ego.... who needs a house like that!? I couldn’t even afford a bathroom in that place! lol One mortgage payment is about 7x what I make in a year! 🙄
jonas nunez	If i win the megamillion i might just make an offer.
MrRod	Im sure this house didn't even cost more than 40 mil to build....

B. B.	I wouldn't want this house, if I were the richest person on Earth. It has no class, no substance, and no redeemable qualities. It just wants to flash cash, and luxury items. Empty.
Greg T	Nobody cares about ur $81k anchor bro
hzhang1228	this house has gone down more than 50m even before the "first sail" >_>. even billionaires only buy things that they feel is worth the money. this house is a few stacked concrete blocks warehouse style with a lot of trinkets and toys to dazzle the young billionaires with no taste for architecture. modern architectures are nice with the open space, bright lighting and big windows only when they flow together and are functional. this looks like plastic surgery overload. with this amount of money this house could be laid with beautiful stone, not concrete forms. the dude that buys it better really like it otherwise it is a major waste of money no matter how rich he is.
Gerald Njuguna	I would like to hear Grant Cardones  comment on this house. I'm sure it won't be pretty.

urmaker	Personally, If I were to spend $188 Million on a house I would want to design it from the ground up. This one is amazing. Just not my kind of thing. Well, obviously with a price tag like that!
Dominic	Wasn`t this 250m not that long ago?
SB NICK	77M off original asking price + inflation as big  as it is currently... ima wait another 2 years
steve	Not impressed in the least. Its easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than it is for some hollywood smut to enter the kingdom of God. Sorry to burst your bubble folks. LOL

RPDBY	piles of useless carp
Koroz	cool, now lets feed the world instead of buying stupid shit like this.  Thanks.
goatmonkey2112	It's funny to hear him talk about yachts being depreciating assets, then scrolling into the comments to see that the price of this listing went from $250 million to $188 million and still hasn't sold. If I'm paying that much I don't want to have my money going into someone else's taste. That camera thing is pretty gaudy. You might talk about how much stuff like that is worth, but if I don't want it, it's worth nothing to me.
Stickyfingers	I love the fault door to the wine cellar. The house to cost $250 million

Chey000 0	It is not just the price of $188 million, but you have to pay for the 700 employees included in the house and that 24hr security cost oofff no thanks
Xhander	That house is nazi af
gycy gvufti	Lol it used to be 250 mil and the owner said he wasn’t gonna drop the price, I guess he gave in, lol
A T	take out name brand stuff, cars, useless helicopters, art, 2 million dollar stairs, half of the bathrooms, other expensive materials, and it's worth a lot less. Some much random unnecessary stuff in this house that drives the price up. It's 62 million dollars cheaper and even with these youtube videos here to try to help sell it, it's not selling. Yeah, the view is beautiful, but there's other houses with a nice view too.
S F K E D U	This is what happens when a rich dude just throws in some money on useless expensive shit and price it up to $250 then to $188mil and expect someone to buy this crap. No wonder why till this date this house is not yet sold for $188 also, bullshit
Eko	That hammer probably costs more than my college tuition
ThugFox Gaming-TFG	If I'm rich I'll buy this house but I'll  remake it too my own design for a huge mansion like this
Daniel Worley	This is a home for a Liberal Elite. The kind that tells the rest of us how to live! Crazy it's smack dab in the middle of crazy California. It is in a home in a guarded neighborhood. The home is surrounded by a wall and has an armed guard on watch. Feel free as you look down on the society that created your wealth from a balcony overlooking the poor. Its okay those people are way down in the bottom of the valley. You're completely safe,  those people aren't allowed within a mile of you. The police, the wealthy and political elite has made it ok to cut down any of those people who want to even try to get close to you.   You will have a problem though. People will figure you out.. one way or another. Rural America has had enough of California Elite. You will be weighed and measured. You could of helped everyone.. Instead you make money off of charities that say they help. You make money off your face from charities by doing commercials and psa's! Tight knit group of theives you are!  Final thoughts FUCK YOU New York, Chicago, Atlanta,  Philly,  LA, Portland, Tallahassee, DC, and especially Miami! You're the problem of this country. You breed ignorant stupidity.
ItsJosiePosie	As nice as that house is thats a crazy amount of things to have in a house. Also 21 bathrooms!? Probably for everyone who'd be shitting bricks upon seeing/walking in that house lol. Its cool but too much. A normal cozy home would be perfect tbh

Erich Wagner	That house has been going for 100 million dollars less on Zillow for the last 2 months so it’s kind of strange to see them say the price is literally more than double what it has been. 88 million, not 188 million. Guess they’re really pushing for that coming mega millions winner to pull this one.
JJ J	If all that stuff comes with the house, you could buy the house, sell all the stuff then resell the house and probably make a decent profit

KentrYT	0:41 RIP Paul Allen...
Vincent Corleone	The definition  of buyer's remorse is buying this house
Robert Heed	Insane. That's crazy
Rob C	LMAO, $188 Million for a house. First one in line to hell when this owner dies is the only certainty.
Jameel Ja	Definitely not worth $250M nor $188M. *But what do I know, I live in a van down by the river!* There's a lot of stuff in the house that are useless, like: helicopter, cars, motorcycle (this is coming from a car/bike guy)
KappaW	don't understand what makes this place worth 188million, sure its luxurious but there is nothing about this home that screams "entirely new". It's just another mansion, with more money wasted on pointless shit, like honestly 2million for that staircase? The materials and labor cost are probably less than 100,000$, clearly has been marked up artificially for some sort of dick measuring contest. Nothing about this home is impressive from an engineering perspective, its just people tossing money around to show off.  Id be much more impressed by something with some real engineering and creativity to it, not just handbags made out of expensive stone, like honestly what a complete waste of money and imagination.
SiD TheKid	Throw a project x in this
Arthur Watts	'Insane' is right. I'm all for folks aspiring to reach their potential, and I dont plan to don a sackcloth anytime soon, but you can guarantee that there are *families* sleeping in their cars within 20 miles of this house. Tell me there isn't a point where someone can have more money than they know what to do with.    This is a 'hotel' that does nothing more than consume resources - best case, it may impress potential clients. Will Smith's $2M RV makes infinitely more sense than this - he steps out of it onto the set of a movie where he's making money. Horses for courses.
Devin Edwards	Looks like I’m robbing a couple thousand banks!
Ricardo Ibarra	I wonder how many people would have to occupy this mansion for it to loss that lonely feeling
kjz28	Throw the art in the trash, and get rid of the stupid stuff like the $250,000 sink, and you have your self a keeper.  The collection of cars was a good mix.  The "choppa" is gorgeous.

Thomas of All Trades	The guy showing the place shouldve worn a lavalier as well.
imober	Why are rich people rich ? Umm they don't spend 188 million on a house that won't sell. Oh 2 million dollars for what stairs oh wait you made the number up because you can ohhh. That's why they won't sell this house they spent 50 million on everything and then buy cars, helicopter and then put a price take of 188 million. Which came down from 250 million. So let's see that how can one come down from 250 million to 188 million.

jdiscount	Honestly, even if I could afford such a house I really wouldn't want something so big. The requirement to have butlers and staff constantly in the house would be exhausting for an introvert like me.  Need my alone time.
Galo Arizaga	I rather switch the bathroom to room ratios
Matt	Awesome. That's insane. Crazy
JONNYKILLA	62 million loss in 2 years hmmm almost like its not worth that

-Joe-	I love luxury listings
Nguyen Duong	The monthly maintenance fee on this would be enough to buy out my house lol
Joseph X	Has everything except a buyer. Good advert though
YouOnlyLiveTwice	Just like the designer handbags inside it, the house's design/features is really tacky. I guess it fits that city real well though and the people who live in it. I'm actually surprised there aren't picture frames on the wall made from elephant tusks or carpets made out of panda fur.
LukeFili	It dropped 60 mil in price jc no one would buy it
Artic 17	what is the song playing at 6:04 in the back ground

alex weis	Kinda a joke of a tour if you dont even go into the master bedroom... just saying bet you had fun though
zootherius	Listed at $250MM almost 3 years ago, then relisted at $180MM earlier this year, whereby the actual estimate for this home is $45MM.  This home is such a greedy money grab banking on a super rich fool who just wants the fame of buying the most douchey home in the US.  The main reason for this buffoonish price tag is all the gawdy artwork, finishes, unusable cars, and legally unusable helicopter that anyone spending this money would want to custom select.
Gru	This entire house is completely tasteless
adrian kovalski	you know out there  there is a stupid person who would win the lottery and actually buy this house
Fabio Costa	"Thats crazy"
92kosta	The price was $250 million untill recently. I'm waiting for it to drop down to a more reasonable $100 so I can buy it. That made me thinking... I could even profit after selling that chopper. Yeah! That's what I'll do.
Allan Ombina	when it rains?
Punk Taco	You're not allowed to fly that helicopter in that air space. What a waste!
Keith Doran	Absurd
jesus oct.	Lmao, they keep lowering the price.
EJR77	This is a for a very specific type of person, even if I had all the money in the world idk if I would want to live there. He talks about how the asset doesn't depreciate but I cannot imagine wtf the upkeep costs of that house are and that might as well be the same as depreciation expense
MrStanderd5000	100 million dollar mansion but $7 audio jeesh

kiwibob72	I don't care how rich you are, just how small does your pecker have to be to build such a place?? (and on that note, is this trump's house?? - LMAO!!)
h berm	do you take pay pal?
Xavier Guida	Could we get on a call Ryan? I’m 17 years old. I’m in Real Estate licensing school to get my license. I will be getting it this febaury when I turn 18. I’m always looking to gain more knowledge…
Luxeee	Mega Million lotto is at 1.6 Billion and after taxes you should have around 560 million so you could buy this house whoever wins the lotto
Greg	SAME:)!
Rasmus farkas	The kind of people who can afford this house, don't have any spare time to enjoy it
Dileep Prashank	1% of this house could feed thousands of children who suffer without food. sad reality..
NeccoWecco	You can be the richest corpse in the cemetery, or you can change countless peoples' lives.
Rod Long	You REALLY should have mic'd the agent. That was nauseating to listen to. And the white noise was louder than their conversation.
Jesse Salomon	I have three dollars
Jithin Raj	Lol from 250 mil it dropped down
Tony Tunnell	If I only had a hundred eighty eight million dollars I could possibly have 40 freeloader friends to come over and watch TV and play video games and swim in the pool
It's Dark	I could live in one of those rooms and he would never know.
Justin Hess	I love how he keeps calling it an asset. A true asset makes you money, this is more like a HUGE liability! haha Still a very dope house though!
Lucas Williams	Human greed has no boundaries
umbrellaman08	$188m and no garden?
BIG SIN	This is the largest most magnificent, most beautiful waste of resources and space I've ever seen, a prime example on how we are wasteful, and live above our means and waste money on meaningless bullshit. Stupidest shit I've ever seen.

MiyukiSawada240	https://www.instagram.com/shantedidathing/
PeacefulKojo Play	Lol from $250 mil it has decreased now to $188mil? That's what's up
Roger Dorn	I’m all about amazing architecture and design and huge houses, but when he’s talking about how it’s an extremely smart way to spend your money that’s just not true. Those ultimate mansions are usually on the market forever and usually have to take a big discount before they sell. Smarter to get a $10-20 million mansion and use the rest of the money for income properties. Still an amazing house though.
Johnny Bravo	Maaaaaaaan im living in a basement ...
Bushmane Ent.	"come back anytime" which actually means... "dont come back" ;)

Blakedjdm	I’m almost 100% sure dan blizerian bought this house a couple months back for personal use/ parties to promote his new company “ignite” and only paid a cool 100million
ERICK LOPEZ	This man is a good salesman. He’s making you think that the house you live in is a asset and not a liability. That’s where he stands incorrect. If you live in your own house it’s a liability not a asset.
Walid Touahri	Daaamn
John Curtis	So homely
Anubis Anubis	Fuk that shity house.....soo many chairs....i guess there is always bunch of fucking retarder people in that house.....soo where is the peace...after i long  work...traveling etc....it would be nice to come in quiet house...not party

CriptoPower	I'll have my whole fam leaving there.

erick canto	Thanks God the comments section is not disabled.
Angel wick city	That mansion used to be 250 million but they dropped the price, tbh I don't think nobody will buy it for that much,

Godly Potato	I love luxury listings
Alex Ortiz	This guy either says insane or crazy
Byron Glass	The one question you can repeat throughout the tour? "You wanna see something cool?"
TheCornbeefsoup	A 300k bathroom? A $2 million staircase???  See it's the unnecessary interior accessories that inflate the price of this house. Give me this same house with  regular bathrooms and staircase and whatever else that's gouging the cost then the price would be more attractive even though i still wouldn't afford it lol
Rowkzy	Holy fuck
banana monkey	i'd use a different toilet every day to take a shit
nick sandhu	Am gonna but this after winning mega millions
Prathamesh Chavan	looks this house is on sale from long time...is was listed fpr 250 millions before 😅
Faisal Khan	Last time i heared it was 250 M. where is the value

Tejas Kulahalli	It's just a party house 🤣
matthieu phaneuf	This is a house but not a home . It emphasize things instead of the people living in it . You’d get tired of it because it’s just an expensive gadget.
Thabo Dennis	Insane, that's crazy, wow, awesome.... lol 😁😁
Lyrical L	Ooh I figured it out now...take the “most expensive materials in the world” put it in a mansion & mark up the price as high as possible
Omar Blackman	This one and the boat too..never miss An anchor in Monaco bein on the map
Quorkscrew	Recreate half of those things in that house using cheaper material that looks the same.......
My Name Is Daniel	If I was rich I would buy a normal house that's okay for me. I don't need to spend so much money on useless mansions. Only celebs and multimillionaire would spend these mansions.
Kevaughn Ford	That house should be in Dubai not America😂
AFreakingHippy	so many "why"s left my mouth during this video
derper derp	I can't wait to get into banking, lie my way to CEO, sell my soul, fuck over 10 million people, suck off politicians, buy this house and look into the mirror knowing I should be burning in hell. At least I can wash my hands in quartz while millions lose pensiond and 401ks.
Umer Zafar Tarar	Watching this makes me kind of scared...and a question rises in my mind...does people only care about material things nowadays???..i mean this house s beyond ridiculous but scariest thing is that 90 percent of people will envy it throughout their life knowing that they can never afford or even buy this type of luxury...
Mansor Sarwari	In heaven it will be infinit time's better than this. Imagine
dekic13236	Is that a final price......just asking for a friend ? :)
WarHawk Gaming	188 million on a city with the worst air quality Haha no thanks
Brahmajit Saha	Just to let you guys know this house was priced $250 million 2 years ago
Rafael Dunn	House used to be 250 000 000 when finished 😂😂😂😂    now 188 000 000... ill just wait till its 15k or somethin to afford it

Hassakrame	I Love Luxury Listings
Pieter8485	I mean its amazing what people are able to create and build its truly wonderful, my house is worth that staircase haha
Eddie M	The Guatemala caravan on its way shall offer plenty staff to clean and maintain the place.
Jack Li	Listing agent’s mentality is not at that level yet for this type of listing... if Mark Cuban & Paul Allen’s yacht don’t make sense, then this entire house don’t make any sense!!!
elmo omle	Why do all these mega mansions appear to be designed by 24 year old  wanna be hip hop moguls with zero understanding of aesthetic and class?  Absolute zenith of gaudy. Terrible.
Axiis ZA	This is where Tyga shot the taste vid
obicapa	Yearly taxes $188,000 per year.

AlexGamingRandoms	Imagine playing hide and seek in there 😮
Michael Jay - Value Investing	I would rather have a $1M house plus $187M in cash than a $188M mansion to be honest.
L R	I have a strong feeling this house will be auctioned off for much less than $188 Million during the next recession
NickKhan	“Sure”
LORDE 2729	if i pay 188 million dollars, i expect it to come with its own JARViS that takes care of all my needs. i still dont see the point of owning a house which will only add in maintainance and security fees and my god, the mansion tax will kill u eventually.
Joseph Abell	What's the song at 5:12?
Sir J	Wonder why carlton could never get it....
Yiyang Wang	i just like your demeanor, very calming while I enjoy this excessive bit beautiful house
Verse Hero	if i'm going to have a 188 mil house im putting ever fast food restaurant in there and a few fancy ones
maxmmpower	opulence has been around for some time (see: venderbilt), but at least those gilded homes had grand libraries stocked to the hilt. this has, uh, a giant screen in every corner (by the pool!), so you never miss an episode of american idle...
NotTheBestGaming	Stop making me dream about this 😂
Purple Leaf	😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Donnavan storr	they can use there house to help poor people i believe.why do you need 30 rooms if nobody going live in them
Smsrules1	The real funny part is that the people who have enough money to purchase this mansion are too busy travelling to actually live there full time. They're smart enough to buy 20 different properties that are still worth less than this property.
Darzae Alonzo	"Sure"
PAblo Carvajal	Also love the views and trees around .
Lion	"Got 10 bathrooms I can Shiii all day" - Lil Wayne
Matt Barrell	Ryans 2 cents... "that's crazy", "that's awesome", "that's insane!"
Lee Borders	Why does this guy have sliver hair he looks retarded
koolkokujin7015	F U money.............................
Samruddhi Deshmukh	*amazing*
Eben Dickson	They’ve been trying to sell this for more than a year now used to be 250 million guess they reduced the price
FashionBombTV	I love luxury listings
Yeshudas Nair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8teHLSIdLqM I think this is the same house price over $250 Million. So now the price has been dropped to 188 million $. cool

Hasso El Ati	we love queen b in the back

cody baggett	It went down 62 million since it was originally put on the market a couple of years ago and they're still having trouble selling it.
Robert J. Holtz	Hey, if I knew you gents were gonna make a video of my house, I'd have come home to say hi to you all! ;-P
Chris Newman	One helluva pad! 👌
RBB	Take a shot every time he says insane

Juan luis	Is it me or he looks like ryan reinolds?
Geeky Alex	Isn't it the one Dan bilzirian had ?
Limario Oppa	wasnt it $250M around last year?
John White	Only in broke ass California is that home worth 188 million. In my state, it would be around a 60-70 million dollar home.
11-12	Lol theres was another vid on this wayy back and it was 250 mil i guess he hasnt sold it yet
cr8ive	You say the value of property keeps increasing . . .yet it started at $250 million ,  now its sitting at $180 million . . .guess this is delaying your $500 million dollar project?
Becca Hargate	Obscene.
Kevin jones	Beyond ridiculous and not an attractive home.  Looks like a freaking office building!
Robert Harrison	its an amazing house, but it doesn't really feel like a home. Its more of like a super expensive mall.
Prateek Upadhyay	DEAR SHIV JI. LET ME BUY THIS HOUSE IN NEXT 20 YRS AND I WILL NAME IS SHIVMAHAL
seekwsdom	Its crazy to imagine but Kylie Jenner can afford to buy this house
paul vg	So tacky, yikes.
Juan Claude	MFW I Know you could build 5x the same house with all the amenities for 10% of the cost, just by not using designer crap
Lucas T	Thanks for introduce a nice song at 9:58 Whoever is wondering may go https://soundcloud.com/superparka/skip
Fxoes	This Guy said 17 different words during the tour lmao
BAYOU Amine	a 188m mansion ? Yeah why not!  We've ended world hunger, right!
M&N Distribution	Not a bad price for a home this size
Denis Sulovic	They are only doing this video because no one wanna buy it 🤣
bond james	Unreal
100000 subs without video challenge	Ryan says sure a lot
Torbjörn Sundborger Sjölund	I imagine Bill Gates buying that house if he lives next to it just so no one disturbs him during the day
Dixon	Jaz and Beyonces House
GKrastz	Sponsored by Louis Vuitton?
Emmanuel Santiago	That's crazy,that's insane
TheVirus455	can you pls stop saying insane and crazy after every explanations..... crazy.
sanjay kumar	Sorry sir you incidentally built a museum not a home
Jalen Curtis	I would buy that house so I can fee like Batman
CAMERON FELDHAUS, REALTOR	Will the Seller offer a 1-year subscription to Netflix as a concession?
Paul Jack	金持ちですね
1tecladocasio	I feel sad that you feel sad living the house
matt casalinho	There is so many unnecessary things in this house.
amrit hehar	Visualize and then execute
Yassa Arafat	Meanwhile people die of starvation -_-
Nate Tringali	I Love Luxury Listings
GirlMeetsTech	"Insane" and "crazy"...you should get a thesaurus.
ryan klein	He probably invested in lifeinvader before it crashed.
Jonathan R	This house was just worth $250 million so.... It's depreciating
Billy Maze	Luxury listings :O
Successful Landlord	even if a billionaire I wouldn't spend a dime on that shitouse
Super Magario	I wonder how many people need to die for these stupid luxuries. A few million? By the way, I think enslaving people by economy is still murder.
Prinz singson	is this dan bilzerian's house??
Majestic13	he forgot to mention that the heli got no engine and its illegal to fly in that area.
Calvin A	This house is an example of having more money than sense. They saw him coming.
Kamlesh Patel	Lol -  is that it
towedmycar	I'll take it.  Right after I win the Mega millions jackpot. ;-)
Hounslow Parks	They still trying to flog this house? It's been on the market for ages
One on 1	Thats shit i can have 20 of these that look 10 times better in Europe!
Dennis Rojar	Crazy nuts
c. lince	even billionaires wont buy this crap
billionaire prince 11 yrs old	That's really crazy too much luxary in one mansion these can feed all the people dying from hunger for years!
Rhea Barot	I would buy this only if I won the 1.6 billion dollar lottery!
Aaron	the house is worth around 70mill in my opinion... adding the cars , wine bottles , louis vuitton stuff and camera is all good and nice to look at and to look prestigious but in reality that means nothing.. Its the barebones of the property that matters...
Chris Freely	@1:12 I'm not a fan of men that turn away while you're speaking to them. I find it childish, unprofessional and rude.
TheLastSpartan04	* impoverishedness intensifies*
Philip	At 2:54 you can see a card that says 250 million. The title says 188 million. In the beginning of the video he tells you it doesnt lose value. What a load of crap
Almosta Farm	You prove you can do well with a very limited vocabulary.
Nilo Baranda	Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg can easily afford that but they're not into that excessive lifestyle. Rappers and pro athletes would like to have that but I don't think none of them would be wealthy enough to afford it and maintain it. That leaves you with Saudi oil billionaires or God forbid.....nouveau riche billionaires from China.
Galag	This is just a big house full of over priced shit to drive the price up...
First Up	Ryan, pick up some books if you're not already reading every day.  They do wonders for a vocabulary.  Somebody in sales that repetitively uses the same type of words needs to upgrade their vocabulary.  Getting a word just right makes all the difference in the world.  And it makes a video far less grating to watch.  I realize in a situation like this where everything is so unique and different it must have been overwhelming, so you have our sympathies.    Now get reading!
jami amelia Dior	Hmm. Ryan is hot .
Hey Grips	what a waste of money. imagine how many companies and new projects you could fund with it. so lame
john doe	The house is basic for that area. It’s all the “art” and cars etc etc in the house that they’re trying to push onto the new buyer which is driving up the cost.
Jesus Lopez	Aye guys, I'm starting a GoFundMe to buy this house, anyone that contributes +10 Million, gets to live in the house. Everyone else, can come visit once in awhile. :)
DEIMOSLOL	if you could even afford to buy this house, why would you even bother buying it? You could just build your own house to your own liking lmao no point
Hisham Alhusaini	even if i was a billion aire theres no point of owning a 25 bedroom home that would always be empty
Bojan Kis	Only a man with worlds smallest dick will by this stupid house. 300 000 sink : ) what a load of crap.
Lee Stevens	Some people are so lucky to be able to have houses like this, and some people are so skilled to be able to create houses like this. I wish I was either.
Taco Farmer	It only makes sense to own a house like this if you are running a business here. Your prospective market for selling a house this big is simply too small. Really, anything more than a $10 million home is unnecessary for personal use.
Noggahide Gaming	Didn't the guy who sold Minecraft own this house?

Lulu	That's crazy. That's insane. (repeat)

ThaCarti	That massive Leica camera is amazing. I love Leicas that is just beautiful
David Hollifield	I hit that crazy one billion dollar megamillions, there will be another one of these built LOL..
Spiritual_eggnog	It doesn't feel like a home.
Simanta Dutta	Problem with this property is that it's made for a person with very specific taste and if I don't like that taste, I could get 5 times the luxury & space for 200 million in LA.
_Dust - GFX	Ima prepare my money right now Wait for it
meteda1070	I find this level of opulence repulsive.

Aaditya Desai	I bet if he sold all 21 bathrooms then probably it'll be worth a whole new goddamn house!! Insanely crazy.
tgh435 lzl	That moment when the sink costs more than your own actuall house xD
Sean Fitzhugh	This guy really thinks a $188m mansion is going to appreciate over 10 years. Lol
david s	Great, now I can really go hang myself after seeing this video... working 2 jobs , trying to keep a roof over my family’s head and food on the table .... living check to check. Not sure if this is a kick in the ass to be motivated to try and earn more or to give up on the fact that I’ll always be broke.
Nikola Tesla	Great. Now let's give these people a massive tax break and wait 12 years until doomsday.
srbija13	Great video Ryan, keep up the great work. Loving your videos.
LeFat	the commentary along with the video is mind glowingly basic....its like listening to 2 frat boys with no education. Id be embarrassed Ryan
Apple Pie	if that was in north daokita, that house probs would cost 1.5m dollars lole
David Campagna	I'm pretty sure the Bugatti is not $4m. I have a feeling a lot of the numbers the "guide" is throwing out are exaggerated.
David Garray	First time seeing Ryan that speechless... his only follow up answers were "wow", "crazy", "amazing", "awesome", "insane" and the odd "sure!" ;-)
Amir ajouli	i thought it costs 250M€
Anders Heli Hansen	Crazy
Orange Trees	An abandoned mansion in the making
Edwin Cruz	I will buy this house mark my words ...
radiogreenblue	Yeah but ask anyone who has spent a week as a guest on a large megayacht and  a similar person who stayed as a guest in this mansion. I guarantee you the reaction from the guest who was on the boat was far more enthusiastic.
phew	Insane! Crazy!! Insane! Crazy!!  Is there something you want to say other than this?
SleepyDoopy 1	"Amazing"
Larry jacobs	Was 250 now 188 it's came down 62 million in 2 years since it was built.

Subway Surfers guide	That fire extinguisher was amazing 😂
davibrass	If I'm in the market for a $188M dollar house, I'm not buying someone else's cheesy-ass tacky house. I'm having my own tacky cheesy-ass house built!
Paul Donald	That’s insane? Work on your vocabulary
Chips O'Toole	One word - "Hideous"
M Tung	Nobody is going to buy this house, at $188 millions( it already went down several times from $250mil to $188mil in a year or so), only the top .000001 percent of people can afford this house and those people usually perfer class, discretion and sophistication over looks unlike the some of normal millionaires. This place has no warmth, its not a mega mansion its a just a glass paneled modern museum.
tigergreg8	He actually seems a little bored here with this home. It’s a decent home, but most expense  is Art , not home.
Emmanuel Lamarre	This video insane
Palash Priyanshu Dutta	i have seen this house before. And it was 250 mil then.
BikeStuff	Ryan, thanks for showing us this. on a side note i would have loved to have seen more of the auto gallery and the downstairs parking. as resident mechanics love that stuff.
david ong	Shot game!!!      Everytime ryan say crazy take a shot
Adam Phoenix	Meanwhile people dying in Africa, while you wipe your ass with Louis Vuitton toilet paper knowing one sheet of that would supply food for one week to a family. The pinnacle of human greed right here...earned or not, all faith in humanity is lost.
XHedge Fund	I heard that the helicopter is non functioning. Is that true? Also, how do you get the cars out of the house to drive them?? Please dont tell me that they are not there to drive but just pieces of art. I didn't know Mark Cuban had a 350 million dollar yacht. Think I will call him to ask what the fuck was he thinking.
cleef thanis	Too extra
SillyIbexe	Song @ 2:46 is Cheetah Tongue by The Wombats

Engin Deniz Ucgun	its so fucking extraordinary
Jaz Rano	We love Beyoncé 😂❤️
Genie54100	Fun fact: The helicopter has no engine because they couldnt get a landing permit. Its just there to look at.
Pete Rock	One point he wanted 250 million slowly price is dropping such over the top. It's insane how over the top this house is. You can tell Ryan is like wtf I miss nyc.
solicify	I’m going to be rich now and you can’t stop me
burnt1ce85	Admit it. You absolutely hate the house
graeme4prez	You have about as much charisma as a brick
Dark Prince	This dude doesn't seems that  impressed at anything.Saying crazy,insane  like  deadbeat. Thats the  difference I felt about him and Eric conover.
Henri Adam	Is it Beyonce's ??
yo Alex	This house use to be $250,000,000 dollars. I guess it's not selling. Contradicting his first statement made about prices going up and boat prices going down lol

Steve L	I dont need 21 bathrooms. Even if i had kids i stills won't need that. So who wastes money like that?
Samuel Danby	Nobody in the world needs this much money. If you hate the 1% you should hate this bullshit.
Allen Han	Guy quotes Paul Allen. Isn't aware he died a few days ago?
xander	He could've lived in a nice quiet home outside the in country while investing his stacks in profitable stocks or new techonology Living a nice life while also helping the rest of the world. but you know, nah fuck it buy this mansion instead
Loli Lulat	had to pause this video several times cuz cant process what im seeing

Farah Aliyyah	A $188 miljoen dollars and it doesnt even have a pool table
SuTen	So much expensive meaningless bullshit in this house - I'm amazed about these people wasting money on total shit.
MurVz	Lol this was 250 Million like 1 year agonhaha
Taylor Drew	This guys is somewhat full of shit dude. The house isn’t worth 188 million if things inside the house is what drives the house. The next buyer is gunna tell you to fuck off get ride of the garbage and give me a real number on the house.  Ahhh 125 piece art collection. So the house ant worth 188 million the art collection is lmao
grim reaper	Some people live a ridiculous fantasy world
JM_04	100% will not sell even with this dude. Too many speculative value: this is valued at $$$ etc. For all we know the actual value is a lot less and you had a contract with the manufacturer to not disclose this and that. Sweet move. Thinking like a billionaire, haha. I'd buy an island with that money, btw.
Anthony Laville	I’m going to reassess my goals right now
Keith Oberg	Words cannot describe but the quicker sale may have been toss the 50 exotic cars the 50 million in unique one of a kind pieces the over the top art  and sell one sick ass mansion for 125million
Christopher Barroccu	Now that is the DREAM HOUSE ive been searching for ...
Shiki Fuujin	You look and sound really uninterested.
Null Zero	"40 of your closest friends" lol
Ray MyeyesRopen1150	Dude do you have a vocabulary? Or is everything just CRAZY to you? My god your touring a 200 million dollar house and all you have said is CRAZY. No wonder o have never heard of you. What a tool..
Roberosein	the only thing i liked is the helicopter itself, other then that its a soulless compound of nonsense.
d1234	Where do you draw the line between a mansion and a fucking hotel.... Cause all these mansions are so excessive you would feel like your living in a hotel not a home... And fuck buying one house for that price...
shawn0md	A house with a bunch of junk in it smh
Dilesh Perera	isn't this dan bilzerian's house?
jessica james	I  deserve this house..
Jacob Gholson	What was in the room ya cant see?
Aïcha Diagne	The house is cool, but I would be more interested in the buyer (if he/she exists). I would love to understand the thought process of someone who buys something like that
Imran Awan	I suppose to see how to fix fuel filter on my 2k Ford so I can save 20 dollars and ends up on this video .....still crying....
Lucas Isdahl	Time to win the lottery!
KhelBoy	I see so many useless expensive stuffs. 🤣
Syed Raza Shah	Why it wasn't pleasing to the eyes?
Piki Sempai	Yo I remember this house used to go for 250million like 2 years ago
mashimaro619	I literally just saw the same house in a video yesterday which was from 2017. It was 240m$ now its only 188m$.
Y4MO619	Does Airwolf come with it?
took sum	Wats the rent eva month
Shivanshu Chaudhary	Isn't this "The One"?? That got listed for 500 mil.   Sad to see it's value fall so much if this is the mansion I'm thinking it is. Edit: the one is 908 Bel Air, this is 942. But the architecture is so same
Alex Black	Ugly.
Matt Esho	Kevin O'Leary's twin brother
Grey Garcia	How about 10$ ?
bennynewqs	haha the sink costs more than the house I'm looking at buying
Gasmandude Duderson	Who owns it?
PROJESTUS PROSPER	OK, who else thinks this this house should be given to me for free, Just because this house has been on market for so long without any one buying it. CRAZY though!
Oh Well	It's lovely in its own right but the sad point is that is that is emblematic of plutocracy and the insanity that comes with it. I mean really, that many bathrooms? Not even thieving Wall Street tycoons have that amount of crap to offload on a daily basis #lol
Dollar Menu Hoe	take a shot every time he says "insane" or "crazy"
Pip Pipster	I will NOT go beyond 187 ‼️
Aiko McEwan	‘Bonkers’
John Justjohn	And imagine warren buffet could do all of that and he never even lived close to that...
Chris Kalmar	Is this not where Dan Bilzarien lives?
anthony diaz	This is no where near worth what they're asking for. The lot isn't even that big or private for that matter (I've driven by it) . I cant think of anyone who'd want all the tacky shit inside either. Not trying to hate but there are FAR better contemporary homes in the area for WAY less.
Jonathan Alexander	it was listed for $250 million right?
Jlv Ak	I bet the real estate agent earns a lot
wafula masika Abbott-jesse love	WHEN IMMORTALITY IS DISCOVERED. I MIGHT CONSIDER BUYING IT
P S	The price dropped from 250 million to 188 million, guys. Now I have the chance to             Dream about it
Philipp Walder	This guy won‘t even mention buying it. This house is way to expensive for him.
lil ron	99% of the video  thats insane.. thats crazy.. wow...
Kingra 90	I'll buy this one. See you guys next life...
Chenlin Qian	Give the agent a mic. This is not about you kept on comment crazy, but the sales introduce the house
Alexander K	Great video. "Flip This House, Bel Air Edition"... buy low... develope... sell high.       If Bruce spent 100 mil on developing this property (which I highly doubt is the case) and it sat on the market for the next 20 years he'd still nearly double his investment at the 188 million price point.  Well done.
Drummer Mark	Wasn't this on the market for 250 million just last year?🤔
Robin Dev	GET THE FOK OUT OF MY HOUSE!@!#$ >:(
Appmaster	Wow If bel air California the richest most materialistic place in the world can’t sell it no one can
Dawood Saddiq	for me my house is better than this!

Albert Bazinyan	1.6 Billion Dollar Shopping List be like:
Dean Hartland	This house has been on the market for over a year lol
Roshan Shrestha	*grant cardone*
Tomáš Novotný	Im able to give you 100 for this
Linkmon99	It’s amazing, but there’s so many unnecessary  parts in there that drive up the value a ton by themselves (like the $2M staircase, that price can purchase a literal mansion in itself). Still I guess if you’re a multibillionaire then it’s whatever 🤯
Akshai	This is unreal
Custos Venetus	🌳 I rather be with Jesús. 🍃
purav sheth	400 million dollar onyx
Will Eberli	And once you have this, nothing will make you surprised or fulfilled anymore... there's nothing else left.

Anthony R	That’s a resort not a house
Alex Lupulyak	my next house
Skyy	this doesn't feel like a home though. If I had the money I'd buy a $1.000.000 house instead.
YouTube YouTube	Too bad I'll have to buy that house now
Martha Gomez	"sure"
Try Knight	Anyone else happy to hear the WOMBATS?
Anh Nguyen	this house was on sale last year for 250 million, guess no one bother to buy so they reduced it to $188 mil lol
Kolsen Ford	take a 100 year mortgage on it with perfect credit. Sell a handful of cars to afford the first two years and then make it a team house for an esports team where you get a percentage of their twitch, youtube, sponsorships, and tournament winnings and you could easily live in this house ;P
hyperrat12	I live in a 6,000 sqm (64,538 sqf) 15 bedroom, 13 bathroom house in Peru that is worth about 20 million dollars, in probably the wealthiest part of Lima... I guess it really is all about location with price lol. Our house is our neighbor's away from being a city block haha
Changez Haider	Ryans speechless
larsson1414	Yesterday i saw a video about the same house. And the developer wanted 250 Million :D
Captain Thunder	i dont get it...ppl actually have this kinda hse for wat??? a giant camera? stones??wtf
Fabrice NY.	This is a what we should all wake up for everyday of our life
Food For Thought	So it hasn't been able to sell so the price has dropped by $76 mill. Oh ok.
Brad Boisvert	I'm happy with a an open style ranch home simplicity 👌
Jaste _	Unnecessary
TheKayaklover	Ridiculous.  Makes me wonder how little the owner's dick . My guess would be peanut size.
Red H	The Home Theatre interested me the most. I think it’s one of the best on earth and must truly be an incredible experience. 4K Image Quality with “insane” sound... 🤤
Michael Salazar	Crazy
B Z	Why is this 188M?
Briap Deum	Why does he sound like Dr.disrespect. and look like him or is it just me?
Darshan Baheti	and then you live it in only for 8 days..
Gorilla Ink Design House	I love luxury listings
Krunal Patel	'THAT'S CRAZY"
andreakxn	ok is it me or is it taylor swift playing on the tv around the 3 minute mark LMAO
Xalgucennia	For a million dollars why didn't Leica just make him a new giant camera?
Gabriel Kotvas	You said crazy 11 times
Nive Yoga	His favorite words: 1) Insane 2) Crazy
RockTown	How many times are you going to say " that's crazy"?😝
Gerald Wong	Is he trying to get Beyonce to buy the house or something? Hahahahaha
A	I've seen a 39 million dollar mansion with 51 rooms on 500 aceres more beautiful than that with hand carved wood everywhere. Plus an 8 mile long driveway. I'm pretty shure you don't need all the toys included plus the overpriced real estate. I have a giant 5 bedroom house with a small movie theater and I never leave the top floor it's a waste of space.
jberda_95	To put this in perspective, Bill Ackman bought an apartment in New York for $90 million. And he is only worth $1.1 billion. Relatively, this should be a significantly better deal, and there are lots people out there who are way richer.
FZJ80	Hey Ryan, what else besides "nuts" and "crazy" can you say?
Tushar	Are we talking about Bruce the 'BRUCE WAYNE' ?
dpactootle	A perfect example of why humans cannot be trusted with too much power. Basically because they are assholes.
Double tap Productions	Still hasn't sold
himanshu	ok guys back to normal life again
ch taimor	no wonder people living in such mansions are the biggest reason of poverty and miseries of the world! and dis sickness is not limited to one country!

Firemel Studios	I'm saving up to buy this in 10 years. I'm keeping track of everything that I do and my people do from now on until the key to this mansion is in my hands.  -Joshua Forsberg, 2018
B Venturous Videos	Anyone hear how is said that onyx wall was $400mil how does that even make sense when the property is 188mil
Eni Ekukole	I am a scientist and an engineer, I find a lot of the articles in the house useless. I prefer a functional design.
Logeekistics	hes talking about investment, so how much would the land cost? and how much did the house cost with materials?  So if someone were to build this themselves for example, how much would it cost with regular but also nice looking materials? Without the fancy hand polished steel etc but just stainless steel, which looks the same.
So What	Realistically, if anyone had enough money to buy a $188 Million home, they'd be old as hell and old people just wanna settle down and live in a cozy home with their family, not all this extra artsy BS...
Broadway	Life
daniel	6:33 only assholes that spend this much money on useless crap think everything's for sale ...
John Nazario	My thoughts on this video: "That's insane."
M Alinoor	This guy is rich ,, I wonder how it feels to have a million in your account let alone billions,, people can solve poverty out there for life
The One Who Knocks.	One Earthquake it all goes away.
Zachary Albinder	I dont understand how anyone could live here.
mkelebay	2 Years, and 2 million to build a staircase? Talking about polishing steel like its impossible? Sounds like this place was built by incompetent fucking idiots. Half the things in this house are extremely personal finishes and touches. It's like someone modifying a car to their specific taste, and then asking full price for it.
Saeed Mahjoubinia	You would pay almost $3 million for taxes every year! Lol
1	Ima buy this mansion soon
Jake White	This is Muskys pad
cool cat like looking thing	nobody would be bold enough to live in a property like this one, not Jeff Bezos, not Mark Cuban. Lets say you're not a public figure but you somehow afford to buy that property you surely will make people scratch their heads. You'll be living with so many insecurities. Only a trillionaire can afford something like this, which brings me to the question, if nobody is gonna buy it *who even builds expensive mansions like these and why?*
ega0117	Who owns that Mansion?
Sound City	“Insane.”
Sumer Rana	Some stuff inside this house are useless and crazy expensive
Rosaura Rivera-Melendez	I own a house just like this... In GTA V
Kendall K	That looks like the helicopter from the ol' show Airwolf.
LI BP	Better be fire proof
Jennifer A	Amazing
jotele	nice video... terrible presenter.  at least fake that you are happy!
siddhartha jain	Dropped 52 million since last listing wait for some more time it will be 150 mil soon
Kalani 'MexiShark' Gapido	I thought Dan Blizzarian lived there? Maybe he rents it but hes there almost every time he is in L.A.
Koiden	The only problem I see is that the house is so complete I wouldn't need to leave my home for anything except for food (which I could order)...
Funding Gym	AMAAAAZING!
Tpucky_gaming	Well when I win the lottery I’ll be buying this lol
Megan Bailey	From USD250m to USD188m Imma wait a little longer
Architeuthis Dux	Such an unimaginative and ostentatious place to live. Money can't buy creativeness, taste or originality.
L	that's crazy. that's awesome. sure. nuts. insane. (checks his suit, because he needs to look good on camera and really doesn't give a fuck about what the other guy is talking about). bonkers. sure. whatever.
kumi w	Great video. Anyone know the song at 10:00. Thanks
Riki chan chui	That’s crazy
achillesfury	Ryan's response to everything - sure 188 million - sure
mnoell35	This house is a one stop shop. He’s catering to people with “more money than god.”Really rich people are into exclusivity. That’s why it’s filled with “one-offs.”when you’re angling to catch their attention you better have an world-class presentation. This house is damn near a museum. I mean really rich people’s homes look like museums anyway. Right?
kashani3102	THAT WAS AT 250MIL AND NOW AT 188MIL THAT PRICE IS GONNA  KEEP GOING DOWN DOWN BABY AHAHA NO ONE CARES IF YOUR OFFERING THOSE DUMB ASS HIGH POWER TOYS WITH THE HOUSE.   A PERSON WITH THAT MONEY ALREADY HAS MOST OF THOSE TOYS. WASTE OF TIME   WATCHING THIS VIDEO AND TYPING THIS COMMENT AND YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO  READ THIS COMMENT
Boxing Physique	Thats crazy

Michael Statia	As nice as this is ,even if I had the money i I would prefer a couple of nice mansions instead of 1 mega mansion
sandrine le blanc	airbnb?! 😂
Mike B	THIS HOUSE WAS 250M IT'S NOT SELLING. I Remember a totally different Youtube video last year
Jonathan T	I remember seeing a video about this grotesque home when they were asking 250 million... been on tha market that long, huh??
Crypto Glenn	coming down in price, now I just need to wait for crypto to blow up
BradleyWelshTV	too cheap
Julio Ortega	Beyoncé crazy in love from the I am tour playing in the background lol 😂
Apoc	The helicopter isn't a real heli right?
Eddie Munster	Only $188 million? Hold it for me. I am just waiting for my mega million numbers to hit.
Alex Ohana	People this is a DEAL in the current real estate market. Like he mentioned at the beginning of the video, a yacht worth 3 times that house will depreciate to 1/3 of its value in only 5 years, while that house is likely to double in value over the next 15, as you live in it and enjoy yourself. A smart decision really. The only thing that’s excessive is all the art which adds substantially to the ridiculous price tag
DCfreakshow	The motorcycle is NOT 0-120 in less than 3 seconds.  I know cars and bikes.  Think about that for a moment.  No car is even close to that fast.  Not the P1, 918, Egg 1:1, nothing.
Tyler cox	I could never live in a house that big
Ty Jiyarom	His reaction face on 5:29 when he saw the row of tequilas lol. Parties for days.
Ben Saph	This house has been for sale for a couple years now, nobody ever going to buy it
Emmitt M. McAdams	They talked about Yacht depreciations. This house was listed JUST 1 year ago for $250 Million.
Mo aljomai	0-120 in 3 sec and a 4 million dollar Bugatti veryron this is number 1 bullshit
jctai100	expensive gaudy trash
Gen bekebeke	all good man, but honestly its not a home, I couldnt be happy there, without a doubt, on the other side I guess a house of one or two millions would be perfect
7 subs but no videos?	Something I could only dream of
Michael R	What happens if there is a bad earthquake will homeowners cover this?
hetcer	end times
Kevin Riva	inst this dan bilzerians house
A Retarded Orange Ape In The White House	I still don’t think it’s worth that original 250 mil, or even 180 mil now. The perfect price for this would be like 85-100 million.
Noneofyourbusiness	21 bathrooms and my wife and daughter still wouldn't let me take a shit in peace.......
Shane Harper	Love how Beyoncé’s I am world tour is playing on the tv in the background 😌
Mitch Butler	I love luxury listings
km drzt	Astonishing
Brandon E. Smith	I'll buy it. Let me just call up my friends at the Federal Reserve and have 'em print out a fresh batch of bills.
Sands Real Estate West	WHAT A MONUMENTAL F**KING RIP OFF THIS HOME IS! IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET FOREVER, AND RIGHTFULLY SO! I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO INTO THE SALACIOUS BREAKDOWN OF THIS EPIC "PRICE" MONSTROSITY, NOT TO MENTION, THE SCHEMATIC YET DIABOLICAL SURREPTITIOUS PRESENTATION OF THIS PROPERTIES EPIC OVERVALUATION FALSEHOOD. I'M AMAZED, YET HORRIFIED AT THE CAPER THAT THEY'RE DESIROUS TO PERFORM HERE, AND YET MARVELED BY THE SHEER BRILLIANCE ON HOW THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO RIP YOU OFF HERE! THE HELICOPTER IS USELESS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T "LEGALLY" LIFT OFF FROM "YOUR" HELIPAD BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE WITH THE FAA OR YOU'RE POTENTIALLY GOING TO JAIL!! MAYBE THEY'LL DISCLOSE THIS ONCE ESCROW CLOSES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS "THINK" LOGICALLY ABOUT THIS EPIC FAIL TO SEE THAT THE BUILDER OF THE "CON HOUSE" IS JUST A "CON ARTIST" THEMSELVES WHO HAS CONTEMPLATED THAT SOME RICH BUFFOON IS GOING TO BE STRUNG OUT ON DRUGS WHILE THEY WRITE AN OFFER. SADLY THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN TO SELL THIS. ALREADY DROPPED $62MILLION IN PRICE FROM THE "ORIGINAL" $250 MILLION. BUT THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE....
6ix 4	21 bathrooms I can shit all day nigga
valvertbr	I Live in a place similar to the closet
Taine Kingi	when a rock cost more than a house :/....
Prince	Who the FUCK is Bruce and why does he keep Carving shit out of Honey Onyx?
A L	it costs prob 27.5 mill but property lot , i dont care what b.s you put inside ,like car upgrades useless. all this guy has to do is kiss ass to get commission for selling it but its not worth 188 mill . 2 million dollat stairs that took to years to polish steel gtfoh , if it was titanium then yes maybe.the rest is b.s mark up .400%
MA AS	no one buying that for 188,  its been for sales for 5 years
Blake	wow! crazy! nice! Crazy! wow! insane! nuts! any other fucking useless words you got? Basically this whole series in a nutshell right here "WOW CRAZY INSANE COOL!" this dude got no emotions
Adil Baig	This was 250 million before ?
Mayara Monteiro	I love that Beyoncé is screaming her lungs on the TV
Ali Shah	On ABC new this was shown as $250 million now you are showing this as $188 million so the price went down ????
Elizardo Urizar	It blowed my eyes, mind, everything. Wow. Amazing property to live in. I'm amazed!
RonLarhz	At least half of it is useless stuff
RainyZ Bluz	Give me a home Where the Buffalo Roam and the deer and the antelope play
Goober tuber	That place is never going to sell. You are not allowed to fly or land a helicopter in that area so whats the point of having them and alot of the place is just pointless money spending for the sake of spending money in the hope that some billionaire will find it cool, tough sell.... for 188m you can have a helipad and helicopter you cant use be they are nice to look at.
Alt Start	seen this same video with two different guys talk the same story about this house and its still not sold..
Let's do something Now	That's crazy
Highteenx3	I don't have any money but I have FIFA 13
Bob Boob	113,000,000....My final offer.
abadi	why is it not selling ? its been on the market for a long time now
Mustafa Khan	2:00 with that sink price you could buy a Mercedes g wagon squared !!!!!
CHAD R.	Chattel doesn’t contribute to the property value and a lot of that stuff is “included in the price”.  Not a great investment like he was trying to sell it as.
Explainer Videos By Lauren	wow and my place came with a free lawn mower
Muaaz Tariq	Am i the only one here wondering how they got that 188 million dollar figure? Seems way more looking at what each piece of art costs
Jakrit Muangkiaw	This house has expensive written all over, classy and tasteful.
Michael Ou	jeezzz this is freaking overkill!! but super cool XD
Sam Kryptonite	You could play hide and seek and you would never be found for atleast 1month
ez zar	The old man talking sounds like a complete douche.
Tsetsi	Why does the helicopter come with the house?
Deadpool	didnt dan Bilzarian buy this?>
emma brattberg	i love the fact that beyonce was on the tv
Rob Behrens	Insane.
Christian Schenks	After seeing this house being for sale for years, it’s obvious that nobody wants to take on such a task of owning this beast/burden.
Ch Chi	No big deal..... I have  Something similar in my GTA account
Earthquaker99	Wow, that’s crazy.
Nivar	it looked more like its ryans house
NobaDyKnowZ	What they forgot to mention is that the helicopter is just there as an accessory, cause you can't have that in the LA area... it's basically worthless
로스현	"Crazy, insane, nice, awesome" rich american mansionowner.
Padi Hiran	This place is insane, what is anyone going to do with 21 bathrooms
No Honor	Wasn’t this house on sale for $250 million? Guess it’s not selling. LOL
DoubleClutchOnline	How much would it be without all the gaudy trinkets, helicopter and cars that someone else picked out?
Oskar	Did Bernar Arnault bribe someone to advertise LVMH brands?
حيدر العنزي	I can probably die and reincarnate 250 times and still won't be able to make that much money.
Albatros Rexha	This dude is such a bullshitter... he said that Bugatti Veyron was worth 4 million dollars, (worth 1.5 - 2 million) and then he said that speed bike did 120 in under 3 seconds, the top speed is 118! 0-60 in 4 seconds, cars are only thing i know about in this video, imagine what else he exaggerated or lied about...
Twankiez1019	reminder that the rich should be eaten alive for living like this will there are those that cannot afford to even buy themselves a hot meal :)
VvXXXvV	This home owner needs a tax break!
Graeme Talbot	Air Wolf in the garden????? Take my £2.50 where do I sign?
Bryan O'Connor	Insane! Wow that' crazy!
hoyeshi BG	Omg..anybody knows who owns this house? Maybe the prince of dubai
HowToSurvive	This is Dan Blizarians house. Lol,
Krystal/Cicada	Who would win?  188M$ Mansion       One matchy boi
Oskar Pettersson	It’s actually 250million if u count everything the owners had inside of the house
Jose Aviles	Ryan my friend I assume that you are rich and if you are can I be the first to ask you for free money, I really need it, thank you
Modern Skyn Alchemy Handcrafted Skincare	I’m not impressed at all. We’ve passed by and you can get a good view of the home if you drive down Nimes Rd. It’s designed for a flashy “new money” type guy (its an entertainers home and not a home that was well thought out) Someone who likes to party. Seriously 😒 a giant camera and stone handbags??? Wine and champagne in glass boxes instead of a beautiful cellar? The owner just wants to flaunt his money and One thing money can’t buy you is class. Look at Elvis 🕺🏾 As for private movies in your own home?? Um, it’s not a Bel Air thing. The “Bel Air Circuit” is a  phrase (but whatever makes people feel important) and NOT a membership or organization. Anyone who has movie studio connections and the proper equipment to play the films can do so. We’ve seen movies at a home in Santa Barbara. The only smart thing is the helicopter 🚁 with LA traffic, it’s actually practical. But this is one of many LA homes with such a feature.
Im Thrillz	9:46 when i watch fortnite streamers build
Mark Lyell	Who is the dumbass that will hand over $188 Mil and not design their own house with their own bling props...Oh yes, there are actually a bunch out there with a ton of money and no style of their own
Eisen	Oh this mansion price has dropped I think the lastime is 250mil
Mathias Karlsson	Ridiculous
Aryaman Mishra	Useless stuff.
kenszo iris	Drinking game. Everytime he says crazy or insane
MIKE SMITH	Drinking game: every time he says “crazy” or “insane”
thatboyj1211	Absoultely disgusting price and money to blow on a HOUSE. Like WTF
Rockwall	Wtf why are you in my house? I am on a business trip in Dubai, reported to police.
Gui	fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Hypergolic17	Insane, crazy, nuts.
Fredrik Barré	I didn’t that @notch is moving out? Perhaps Beyoncé now can buy it....
atamagashock	Absolutely insane, but if I'm paying that money, i want my own island
Trident Studios	The question is, 2 years later... why is it still available on the market? Why hasn’t a billionaire bought it yet?
Moshe Villaizan	I would like to meet the huge douche-bag that actually buys a house like this. Someone like Erlich Bachman from HBO series Silicon Valley would buy it if he had the money, that's how I picture the owner xD
Lucas Ethan	Trump's mansion when he retires
petiyo101	I got sad when he said Paul Allen 0:41

Driving With Jake	That place is "Crazy" :D #Jelly
Kate	This one is gorgeous, but one time I did a delivery up to Zedd's house which he toured on Architectural Digest and I fucking was in love this was before he even toured it. I love minimalist style homes even in mansion form.

ozorious	Didn’t Dan Bilzerian buy/rent this house a few months ago? When was this video actually filmed??

Lbolting005	Hi 👋 everyone, I’m Jeff SprinkleBerry, look me up, I’m a multi billionaire that owns 7 of the fortune top 15 businesses. I’m the proud owner of this house 🏡 and yes, I pay 💰 $87K a day to live here, but I only stay here 2-3 days out the year. I only bought this house because it’s close to this restaurant that I like when I come to LA, California. Sometimes I’ll stay an extra night because I like to go to another sandwich 🥪 shop down the road that only opens Tuesday through Friday. Anyhow, hope you all enjoy my house 🏠 and to answer your question about the 20+ bathroom 🚽 I have in the house, and yes, 5 of the bathroom 💦 is not in the video, I use it to take personal dumps 💩 that no one can come in to bother me
Zack Nyathi	Lol from 250m to 188m
erfho8y	why on earth are wyou walking around with your phone in your hand???
Ephraim Boomer	I would never buy the house if I could. Too big and I don’t like houses I can’t change for my own taste. However if u had the money I would for sure rent the place for a group of my friends and I for a weekend, lock the doors, and go crazy.   If I had the money I’d design my own house, make it about half the size of that house, and yeah. Idk. I’d rather have a big house that’s not as big as that house but that is of my own design.
11 11	i love it im buying it
Turd Ferguson	Insane..
sommi	you got bit of a cocaine problem when you need to buy a house with 21 bathrooms
Livestronger	down from 250 mill and the new one is 500mill
Emris	Why are half of the pricey items in there useless?
Red_Queen_of_Shadow-Hunters And_Crows	😂I mean it's a really nice house which in all honesty I would buy if I could afford.   But some of the things in it feel a bit like... unnecessary clutter. Car collection? That's okay I guess, candy wall? Cool. But a giant fucking camera?? For what reason? Champagne fire extinguishers? A giant anchor?
Ali Mustafa	Waste of money. Its better to live in 2 million dollar home and spend rest 186 million on humanity
SUH DUDE	If you would've invested about $100 in bitcoin when it was new you could've bought 12 of these mansions if you sold the bitcoin at $15 000

Haden Sorter	Serious payday for whoever sells this
Will Cowan	Doesn't Dan Bilzerian live in this house? How much rent does he pay? Anyone know? haha
Joshua Meza	Club foot = Tony Hawk Project 8
GamingWithYoshi	Didnt dan bilzeran buy this house
Tyler Lewis	The type of people who have this level of money, would not purchase this estate; due to the public is aware of the location/interior/exterior, etc. If you were worth a billion dollars, would you want someone to know the entire area, that will certainly effect your safety
Realtor Jared Laster	I Love Luxury Listings.  I’d have to list probably the top 70-80 most expensive houses in Mississippi to equal this one house. Insane.
Simon Berntsson	"Crazy", what a developed vocabulary this guy has.
N8te dawg94	250million to 188 million. moral is, poeple would rather build their own house to there liking for much cheaper and they want land. thats just a house lol

herrbartels	and let alone the term „insane“ 😂👍🏻
Quita Chroniclez	I want that camera!
JADA TO-THE-O	CRAZY whom ever middle easterner is that buys this house, will spend a total of 1 weekend a year there CRAZY
Chintan Jani	There’s no one on the market to buy this; they’ve been trying to sell this for a while. There’s no shortage of billionaires but most of them aren’t stupid enough to buy something like this. You can get a similar looking house with all the amenities in/around that same zip code for much less. Plus, they’d much rather invest in something that has a better ROI. This is nuts.
Sam Stanton	Guy keeps saying worlds this worlds that. Fuck cares. Waste
Johnnyxp64	the past the data room fast and i hate them for that! 😣😩
Darnell	Everything will burn in the end..
hen chen	You have said ‘crazy’ 12 times.

Papechaser	Dan blizaren bought this house
Pedro Mata	Do you get the stuff with the house?
Carter Garnon	Fingers crossed my mega millions #s hit on Tuesday
taltigolt	i'd clear this house of everything to make it cheaper and then buy new stuff, the honey thing and giant camera seems so pointless even if you're rich, the staircase can be just as beautiful in different cheaper but still expensive material, i bet that tv isn't even oled or 4k.
Francisco Gimenez	Crazy
FINITE	🤡 “...they lived ‘deliciously’ - crazy ‘kitsch’ and friends?!” You decide.
One Thousand Voices	idk bout the bugatti veyron costing 4 mil i doubt it unless theres something very unique to it
Mystery Science Gaming 3000	when you compare it to what the guy said about the super rich buying mega yachts it actually makes sense.
Ibrahim Al-Khalaf	Wow
AttitudeAdjusterAA	seems pointless
ricky martinez	If there is no imax theater and indoor full sized basketball court indoor pool i would never touch this place. If you have tht much money you build your own house.
Julian Jennings	I wouldn’t tour this place because I wouldn’t want to leave
Dan Nguyen	It still hasn’t sold!?
No U	It would take over 7000 years for the average person in california to afford this house
243wayne1	Hahaha!  This house is just going to sit on the market and fucking *ROT AWAY.*  They were asking $250 Million over a year ago.  Yawn...  Class dismissed.
Kahn kahn	The house is very niche. What if you don't like the orange pillows and blankets. 007 was on the walls in the theater....but what if you're more of a Jason Bourne type of person lol. And plus all of the Louis Vuitton stuff is cool but really cringey to have in a house before it's sold. It's like they said let's build a modern mansion and just rack up the price by putting in a lot of expensive cars and art work. The house is a museum. They should just pay for entry and turn it into one. Because even if someone bought that it would be very hard to sell.
Rubyfied	One day, im going to fucking own this, and own many more. I will get to the point where this is going to be some everyday type of purchase. Mark my words
Justin Miner	What a lonely place.
Oistar	I Love luxury listings!!!!!
joe villalobos	Sell a 1 bedroom apartment. And have a 200 gallon fishtank with 100000 carats of diamonds. sell it for 200 million.   Most of this is just ridiculous rare materials and name brands. could of probably built this for 10 million of savings were a concern. But you still needed the size.
COMiKON	Honestly, I wouldnt want to live there
Plant Based	Volume wasn't great and cameraman didn't capture a lot of the home on this "tour"! This builder spent a lot of money on corny art. For that amount if money it should feel like your own hotel with an indoor water park. An Opry Land hotel style would have been so much more impressive with an indoor lazy river with boat ride, indoor shops, etc. This felt like an oversized car dealership 😕

Reegan CP	Crazy 😂😆
Fishfan 2	Not a suprise seeing a 2 million dollar staircase in California considering a house here costs 400k. A 3 room house with 2 bathrooms in a meh  neighborhood near Compton is 400k
Deleted	Not quite expensive enough
Michael Atkinson	I would rather have convenient condensed techie/homie style house then a large over the top empty space home.

John Rockefeller	i cant even afford a chair from that house

HASHlRAMA	So let me get this straight. Is it crazy or crazy?
SB	I LOVE LUXURY LISTING
Christian Howard	There are already so rumors that Jay Z and Beyoncé live in this monster of a house, and for at the beginning of the video I came to the conclusion that it wasn't true... that was until I heard Beyoncé's Crazy in Love being played inside the house, to be exact it was a LIVE VERSION!! This has to be Beyoncé's house... who else other than Bey would pull that? lol
Michael Kensington	Its just ugly.  And that sink made of rock looks ugly.

thebigVLOG	America: The Land of the Haves and the Have Nots
Christian Hayden	Insane
Thompter S. Hunson	It's on the news for more than a year... No wonder why it can't find a buyer, with this preposterous price tag. Just because this moron stacked inside the house every absurd bullshit he could (even a bloody helicopter! lol) he thinks the billionaires are equally moronic like him! Fun fact is that you can see in a card at 02:54 the starting price was "$250.000.000" and the asking price is already down 188 million... 62 million down in a year about! lol And this clown goes on to tell us how fast the yachts are gonna depreciate! 😂 lol! I'm losing my spleen from laughing, help! 😂
Faveness	Not worth it, with 188m I could make the Vatican look boring!
Mexican Power	Used to be 250 mill*

Dan Patrick	Paul Allen..rip! And mark  cuban don’t give a fuck about what you think!   This old man probably will fuck me if the money is right...
Ricky Wong	Person that buys this has zero personality
Ison Reign	And this is exactly whats wrong with the world. Its almost loathsome.
flexiblematthew	DON'T WATCH THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR A POOR GUY SAYING "CRAZY" AND "INSANE" EVERY 10 SECONDS.... IT'S FUCKING ANNOYING..... #MAGA2020

Yuvraj Prabhakar	It was 250 earlier ?? Recession hit hard to rich people also now down to 188 😄
أحمد عبد	Even though I am within the market for these, I don’t see why I would spend that much for just a home. I rather invest that 188 million into other business projects.
Thomas h	Kinda trashy.
Jostein Holen	The sound editing was horrible! The music that starts at 9:55 is way too loud compared to the previous and subsequent clips where you're talking.
Wanda Ray	Beautiful art museum but not very home like
Aravind Sri Sai	The maintenance must be a pain in the ass.

Jung Chang	Damn, a bathroom is more expensive than my house???
Don Vaughn	At the end of the day regardless of what material things we accumulate there is always the law of diminsh value which says over time as humans we get possession only to realize our excitement towards it wears off
happycanadianguy	Hey Serhant.  If I can beat you in an arm wrestle I get 100 dollars off the price.  Deal?

Themojorisin	wGAT IS THE SONG AT 7:32
Golden Boy	I am blown away
Nick Meyer	I thought Notch lived here? Or am I thinking of another similar mansion
Lawrence Briscoe	What's the name of the song at the end of the video?
fearfactz1	Maybe if you live with 20 people, otherwise, there's no purpose to own a house that big. I can already sense the paranoia creeping in from the sound of emptiness while living in the house

Trevor Barnes	This guy really puts the homo in homeowner
Mr Right	Dan Bilzarian actually just bought this house for 80 million dollars! So this video is pretty flawed. They obviously overvalued the house and didn’t get any interests, so they ended up flogging it to the worlds number 1 playboy
Nicholas Trujillo	How much cash does the realtor get for selling this home?

M K	So ugly inside.
Alen Pongrac	Thats crazy, sure , insane.
