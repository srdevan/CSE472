I still enjoy playing fifa 18 ultimate team, but the problem is the transfer market is dry because most of the players are sitting in some clubs and not using them.. if you guys could tell them to atleast list some of the players on the market so who ever is playing 18 can still afford enjoy the game..  thumbs up if u agree

Alfredo Pérez	Skills I think you shouldn’t worry about the reward as much, we want to see all the cool players and new players like Eusebio, Socrates, ballack. This is what this series started for, to display all cool players, not to get the best rewards.

meshari abdulsalam	skillz said he is more passionate about making videos than making the pro scene so as his audience we should respect his decision. I know that most of us would love seeing him in this tournament but think about him for a second, he wants to do youtube and not miss a video more than going to the tournament so lets all respect his decision and stop pressuring him to go  to any tournament any more

Klaas Jan Huntelaar	Am i the only one that lost interest because it’s not a rtg? It’s more of a rmtg and he uses bronze bench with this squad, blocks most pros to avoid them
Parkour Fox	I think he means rich man to glory
Isac Rosell EK18B 363KAGY	When is the road to glory coming?
Rich Green	I feel the community strives to get to an event, dreams of winning and having the 'glory' of being the best at fifa, I don't think you should bother calling it 'a road to glory' seeing as you've taken the glory away by not competing, this is just my opinion, obviously it's a free world so do what you want but why bother asking us? And what's the fun fair gotta do with anything?

Morgan Steele	Vlog the tournament
Erik Alsgaard	People that still make jokes about Steven Gerrard slipping is bad people. Too much is made about the slip. People say that cost Liverpool the league title that year, but it didn't. They lost 2-0 to Chelsea that game, AND what really cost them was the defense. I mean CMON NOW! Skrtel and Sakho in defense in a title winning team? No chance. With Van dijk and Gomez that year, Liverpool would have killed the title race a long time before the Chelsea game. Gerrard was not the one who cost Liverpool the title. He was immense that year as ALWAYS. What a legend. What a captain. And even tho I'm not a Liverpool fan, I admire that guy so much. The loyalty, the desire, the shots, the passing, the passion. The guy was immense his whole career. He didn't win the league, but he won every other trophy possible, and he turned down Chelsea, Milan and Real Madrid to play for his boyhood club. Stevie G was fantastic, and I dont care what anybody says.

Lamar McGregor	Don’t play squad battles anymore
luke piercy	Why didn't you get prime gullit?

the fifa players	If anyone needs a good striker, go and get Lewandowski. He scored 43 goals in 22 games for me this weekend league. His shooting and positioning is amazing
Shahzad Ahmed	I was 10-1 & all of a sudden i started loosing every game and now its 10-10.. Dont wanna play any more.. I dominated most of the games i lost but even after 20 shots i cant score more than 1 goal and my oponent scores 2 goals with 2 shots.. That sucks!!

THAT .GAMER	Why don’t you just buy gullit?
MR Perfect	You should have bought Socrates and gave him an shadow
Joris Visser	Why didn't you get prime Gullit? He is a beast man
Rhys Jones	On twitter, the excuse for not competing yesterday was because of squad battles, which personally confused/upset me because the opportunity for more competitive content far outweighs average rewards for squad battles, especially since squad battles gameplay is dead. However, a personal life with your girl and family far outweighs all of those things, so fair enough. Most of the audience doesn't really care about squad battles, so I would personally recommend putting that lower on your priority list. All love tho, keep it up
jag virk	you sold stevie g........ :((((
ARSH ABDUL	Skillz when are u buying prime eusebio he is a monster for me

Prince of Hallows	If you fo to events more people will know you and your video views your increase
dezmond 757	Skillz I'm disappointed that you didn't go for the pro event, but I understand the reasoning.  I just want to say you can do both.  You can do anything you put your mind to.  I would love to see you on the pro scene because I know you can do it and the booyah nation would love to see you succeed but I support you no matter what. BOOYAH
Fafo Gamer	Love your videos
Rrezon Beqiri	Why do you put RTG on the title when its suppose to be Rich Man to glory, would'nt it be RMTG
Berdzz	When would you start PTG (Poor To Glory)
Goncalo Loleee	If its possible you could try Eusébio
geelong44	What view is he using?
Diogo Gonçalves	Buy Eusébio for striker
Unsuboi	Bro it's easy, just say that you wanted to do what you wanted to do, which isn't wrong? You started YouTube because you enjoyed it, you didn't do it because of your subs and fans that you didn't have, just so you could meet their expectations? Because when you started, the only person with expectations was you. If you change that and stop doing what YOU want to do and start doing what your subs want, then the channel becomes less yours and less you, and that what everyone is here for right? They like YOUR channel? Keep up the good work bro, been a sub for years, don't change shit! :)
Jake 07x	Reminds me abit of the faze censor situation
diaz terpstra	Why not 93 Gullit?
# gamer	Give ronaldo the number 7 not the number 4

chris ramirez1115	Why not Gullit skills?
Wys	No one cares about squad battles
Daniel Alkurdi	Buy gullit
Muizz Khan	Do the POTM Hazard SBC
Zlatan	You already have plenty of size in your midfield Skillz. Matthaus looks fucking insane, so I don't think his size will matter, if he can make it up with being so well rounded. Gullit is probably the only player that can match him. I also run a 41212(2), and what I found worked for me is having 2 big middles, in my case Dier, and Doucoure, and then having Ox (5'9, 85 pace, and H/H work-rates). The smaller, agile, and quick mids are super OP when it comes to chasing down players, and making runs forward.
j Edwards	Can you show your custom tactics
Kim-Jani-Ung	Next episode he sells Matthäus because he is a high/high
stian sand	gullit why dont he use him
MUHAMMAD ZUNAIR	If you play on ultimate in carrer mide why dont you play on ultimate in squad battles ? ;(

Karadabra	Love it skillz, keep up the amazing work
ناصر الصبحي	Bro I have this problem when I switch my tactics in game m my players switch positions permanently. Even though i have them in their right positions. My fabinho stays at st and my st at cdm. So I cannot attack or defend. When i see my game plan from the players rating option, i can see this thing but I cannot do anything. This glitch is fucked up. What am I supposed to do?

Fionn McFall	You said last video you played fit champs for the love of the game
Duh_Dawg	I still don’t understand why you say you’re doing stuff with your ‘girlfriend’... just say ‘my sister’
Beetlejuice !	So, no more low driven shots? This year it's finesse shots outside of the box? Haha, I'm so happy that I didn't buy this piece of shit this year. I've been playing since 03... I'm not falling for this scam anymore.
