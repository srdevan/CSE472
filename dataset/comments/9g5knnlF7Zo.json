Granted, remaking your own media is silly, but that doesn\'t mean that this isn\'t just typical Disney, and have ALWAYS been typical Disney. \n\nVery few, if any, of their big budget cartoons have been original stories. Some are blatant rip offs and some are a little bit covert, but they\'re remakes of already existing stories and folklore either way, just like this is a remake. That said, I can excuse the original animations because they are exactly that: animations. With animations you can create styles and visuals that just won\'t work with CGI. Which is why Beauty and the Beast had a terrible visual style and which is why this movie will have a terrible visual style. Disney is gimping themselves artistically by remaking their old animations. You can\'t successfully recreate an expressive and vibrant animated character like the Beast because when it\'s live action, everything has to be firmly rooted in looking realistic, otherwise the actors look out of place, since you obviously can\'t change the visual style of a person\'s face.

Here\'s why I won\'t pay to see this:\n\nThe formula used - shot-for-shot copying the original film\'s teaser, using the music from the animated film, showing incredibly bland looking actors who look NOTHING like the animated counterparts - is EERILY similar to what we saw with the live action Beauty and the Beast. And what we got with that film was...just bad. I\'m sorry, it was bad. Emma Watson cannot sing. She doesn\'t look like Belle at all (nor would I ever buy her as the "most beautiful girl in the town" - let\'s be honest. She\'s cute. But she\'s also a bit odd looking and mannish in some ways). The CGI just made the enchanted denizens of the castle look creepy, and a lot of it fell flat because it was directly comparing itself to a film that was infinitely superior and, MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL: never needed to be remade in live action, or at all.\n\nAladdin holds up to viewings even today. It\'s a good movie. It\'s a classic. It\'s fun. It has Robin Williams for crying out loud. It is the childhood many of us remember. If you want kids today to be introduced to the story of Aladdin, then just re-release Aladdin and advertise the hell out of it. Just release the animated film in theaters. TRUST ME, kids will still love it. But this? Why? Why make it at ALL? There IS no point. That\'s the issue here. You didn\'t set out to try a new take on Aladdin\'s story that does its own thing and does not attempt to pointlessly mime the 1992 film. No, no, no. What you did here is shamelessly take what was already done, by your own studios, cannibalize it, and regurgitate it at the audience in hopes of making some cash. This is very obviously not done for artistic purposes. It is done as a cash grab, and I am calling Disney on it right now. \n\nShame on you, Disney. Is nothing - not even your own classics - sacred? Look. If I write a book, and it\'s received really well, and it becomes a classic, should I in 25 years re-write it, only this time slightly changing some things and adding photos of real people, and try to pass that off as a new thing? Shouldn\'t I be called on it for doing that? Exactly. \n\nStop, Disney. Trust me on this. Just stop the live action remakes of films that didn\'t NEED to be remade or retold because they were so perfect the first time around. Plus, 2D animation actually allows for you to get away with visuals that just look stupid or weird in live action. 2D animation isn\'t a BAD thing. It\'s not an antiquated thing to be covered up with live action remakes. Be PROUD of the past. Be PROUD of the beauty of those 2D animated features. They\'re wonderful. If ANYTHING, Disney should be fighting hard to keep traditional animation alive and well. It\'s not as if kids today, who have no conception of chronology of technology, will see something that looks like Aladdin (1992) and say "no thanks, I\'ll take Will Smith genie instead because it\'s newer". It\'s not as if the bright colors and bombastic nature of the animation doesn\'t still appeal to young minds. ADULTS are the ones trying to blame traditional animation for the declining box office grosses we saw toward the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000\'s. But it was NEVER the animation style that was the issue. It was that films like Pocahontas, Treasure Planet, et al, simply did not appeal to children because they forgot how to have FUN. The films became lame. The writing became bad or overly heavy-handed. Things became too political and too much thought was given to how PC something was, race this, color that, gender this, blah blah blah. See, kids don\'t care about things like that. They do not care. I was a kid in 1992. I saw Aladdin in theaters. I remember the feeling. It was fantastic and I loved it. If my 9 year old self could see the original and then see the trailer for this, I\'d call it a copy, and I would not be interested, because it comes off as flat and uninspired, even if at that age I wouldn\'t be able to translate that feeling into a coherent sentence. \n\nDisney. You need to respect the beauty of traditional hand-drawn animation. It has a place, even now, and it always will - IF you write it for kids and drop the socio-political agenda plaguing films these days (did you *really* need to insert a gay character into Beauty and the Beast? No. no you didn\'t. Equality is all well and good but make a NEW film with a gay character if you simply must have one, and stop going back and bastardizing your own works (or should I say....the works of the last generation of filmmakers who were in every way your superiors) just to appease some segment of the population that always whines if every single group that ever existed isn\'t represented in every single film ever made. \n\nTell you what. I\'ll make you a deal. If you go back to the drawing board after this film and your inevitable Mulan remake (which, by the way, damned well better not have a bunch of white and black people in there for "diversity" - this was ancient China - don\'t pretend it is anything else) and you ASK yourself "Why did The LIttle Mermaid work so well for so long? Why did The Lion King? Why did Beauty and the Beast (animated)? Why did Aladdin (animated)? Why are THOSE films still so beloved by so many after all these years? ASK yourselves that, I implore you, and try to condense the answer to a list of commonalities between these beloved classics. \n\nAnd then, if you can fathom why it is that those films are still so loved and were then as well, and you take that understanding and set out to make a timeless classic animated (not CGI, lazy-asses) film that does NOT have the usual modern aggressively PC agenda...set out to truly make an animated film with EXACTLY the energy and mindset and thought processes used in those earlier films, and approach it like it still IS 1991...IF YOU CAN DO THAT....I will not only go to see your movie in theaters, but I will actively promote it, for free, across every corner of the web I can reach. And so will many others. There\'s something missing in Disney films and it is that heart and spirit that carried across in the late 80\'s/early 90s. Recapture it. Don\'t try to recreate it in live action. That won\'t work. But you will maybe finally start to realize that when this, too, is met with a lot of displeasure from audiences (look at the comments here - plenty of people are asking why you even felt the need to do this and are saying you can never replace Robin Williams - so you already have a problem right out of the gate).\n\nI say all of this, Disney, because I believe that you still CAN make great original films. If you just stop making live action remakes of everything that did well in the past. It\'s .... kind of pathetic, to be honest.', "JUST ADMIT YOU'RE SHIT": 'Looks like shit......

Because when the first movie was being made nobody anticipated Disney would one day undergo this project of live-action remakes as such nothing within the writers contract was included to guarantee credit for such an occurrence. In other words despite being based off of another person script Disney is under no legal obligation to pay Terry Rossio or any other writer of the Disney animated features that they are now rewriting. Now that could have done it anyway out of sheer Goodwill but apparently that's not in the cards. So not only is Disney making the incredibly risky decision to release Aladdin without Robin Williams and expect for lightning to strike twice to make the fastest gain they can but they are also not giving credit to the people who actually made these movies that they are now starting over despite using a lot of the original scripted word.

During this time period, a majority of India (excluding the south) had been taken over by an Arabic sultan; that is the kingdom of Agra in India (and others). so to summarize, the kingdom is technically Arabic but in the country of India.

I really like Will Smith but it’s just such a magical moment of memories so perhaps a way to keep everyone happy is to use takes from the original vocal and build them into a 2019 animated Genie for this reboot.

Will Smith may not be Robin Williams, but I can see him having so much fun with the role. I\'m just assuming that he\'s the genie. I haven\'t looked at anything about it, because I\'m not interested in the Disney remakes, but it\'s the only thing that makes sense to me. If it turns out he\'s Jafar, then I\'m definitely not going to watch it, because that\'s some serious miscasting right there. \n\nAlthough, to be fair, this is probably one of the movies that could definitely be improved with a remake. The original is definitely dated, by this point. So, hopefully, this time they\'ll cut the pop culture references. Disney, of all companies, shouldn\'t be afraid to try new things. I\'m a firm believer that if you\'re going to remake a product, then you should take it in a whole new direction. I liked the Jungle Book remake, because barring a few of the musical numbers, which fans would riot over if they weren\'t included, the movie was very different from the original.

Think of it this way: The remake of Mulan was casted perfectly. Why? Because they’re all Chinese. The cast accurately represents the culture in which the film is based on. If Disney were to cast a Japanese person (for example) for this film,  that would be problematic. This is because, despite what white people try to say, not all asians are the same.

I grew up watching your movies, and those of Don Bluth as well.  They were inspiring enchanting, and surreal.  And the qualities of moving exaggerated forms, 2d paints given life, was stylistically appealing in its own ways. It brought a reality that that activated and energized the imagination and brought color and warmth through generalization that every little hair on a rendered CGI lion cannot.  You inspired me to love art, I thank you for that.  I just wish you would open your eyes and see the Never lands and Wonderlands that can only be found by your original style.  \n\nI'm not against realistic movies, I love CGI films, but I feel like there's been something missing for a long time.  \n\n\nSincerely,\nTrevor.", 'Tiffany C': 'Caint wait!!!!!', 'samira ahmed': 'About time', 'Millie Wilson': 'Wow and i just remembered something.... robin Williams was genie...

Guy Ritchie..... you’ve got to be fucking kidding me, the guy who’s made the terrible King Arthur movie, seriously? How unoriginal and uncreative can you people get!? The cave should be moving, alive and animated, not a fucking still you’d put on one for your reused-story-Disney on Ice performances. The fade ins and fade outs to make this movie look “magical” is fucking fake and is getting really old.\n\nStop remaking your classics and start making NEW ONES with original ideas. I’ve had it, I’m fucking fed up with you and this god awful monopoly you’ve built. Fox, Marvel, Star Wars, you need to back the fuck off. Beauty and the Bleh was absolute trash and I hope to god it’s forgotten. Dumbo looks just as bad and looks NOTHING like a Tim Burton movie, and oh my Jesus, The Nutcrakcer is even worse. A perfect story with an amazing HARD WORKING creative ballet tradition that will be thrown away into piss poor garbage for a political agenda is disgraceful (and yes, there is a fucking political narrative to those films with Disney being fucking stupid in the SJW Hollywood and dspaite the fact Four Realls and B&B17 are by the same director who is terrible at his job and is uninventive, they both LOOK LIKE the same movie for gods sake)! \n\nThis is why Pixar and the Animation Studios ALONE will always have my full respect, despite the fact that Wreck It Ralph 2 is pondering to SJW’s by making Tiana darker for whatever reason and havin a strong female feminist message showing through the trailers, but nevertheless I can still look past that (hopefully) because I fucking enjoyed Wreck it Ralph. They are always 100% more original than what you’ve become within the past 3 fucking years (yeah no shit they do sequels, they gotta make money, but either way, you have to admit that they put more work into their films than these live action adaptations that are being pumped out YEARLY by the numbers since it’s a trend to follow Marvel studios and the MCU’s style of filmmaking).\n\nBut holy Christ have I had it. I’m sure people will start doing the same if they’d just wake up and open their eyes. But seriously though, Disney, stop it. Do what you do best with animation and creating ORIGINAL stories and content (don’t even get me started on what you do with your parks, because you’re just fucking idiots when it comes to that and disrespectful).

She sold the people the Lord entrusted to her care over to the rulers and business leaders of this world in exchange for money, power and fame, just like a prostitute. The kings want to control us and the merchants want to sell stuff to us. So they turn to Babylon and give her whatever she wants in exchange for one thing – the people! Her merchants use her witchcraft to trick, make sick, and addict the people to their merchandise (like movies, music, food, cell phones, etc) in order to sell more stuff and make more money. Babylon is the one responsible for murdering the true followers of Jesus Christ all over the world who expose her. So the Lord Jesus Christ is going to pay her back for murdering His servants and bring her world to a swift and terrifying end. Don’t get trapped in her punishment! Read Revelation 17-18 to learn what you must do to flee from her. The Lord commands:  "Turn away from evil and do good...The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right; his ears are open to their cries for help. But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil; he will erase their memory from the earth."

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\xa0\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\xa0\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\xa0\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\xa0\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\xa0\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

Yes Robin Williams had a wacky character but it was only due to his incredible acting through a fictional character that is worked wonders.

If your going too realistic you cant incite the humor like when the bird slammed into a pancake after running for his life from the sultan bashing into him with the carpet.  Simple effects like this was all that was needed.  Not unnecessary over the top graphics that take up too much screen time!  Your not trying to make another Avatar so don\'t try!  Aladdin\'s character was crafty, selfish, and stubborn.  He spoke from the heart and expressed his frustrations openly even if it hurt those around him.

I know Disney is making all these adaptions of their old movies to retain the copyrights longer before they enter public domain but I\'m not interested in seeing Disney\'s easy cash cow. Will Smith will do an excellent job as the Genie if he makes the role his own like Robin Williams did with the original Genie before he told Disney I\'m done and don\'t try to hologram me like Disney did with Carrie Fisher aka Princess Leia of Star Wars in Rogue One.

There\'s no need to replace Robin Williams when you can re-use him. \nAs for who could do it better than Will Smith? My vote is almost anybody. He has almost no range. Robin Williams could play everything from a terrifying stalker in One Hour Photo, to a tragic/comic radio host in Good Morning Vietnam to a mournfully inspiring teacher in Dead Poets society. \nWill Smith pretty much plays... Will Smith. Will Smith the MIlitary Pilot in Independence Day, Will Smith the Lone Survivor in I Am Legend, Will Smith the Cowboy in Wild Wild West, Will Smith pretty much as Will Smith in a suit in Men in Black - (they didn\'t even really try at all with that one). I might give him props for Ali or Pursuit of Happyness, but it\'s really rare for him to stretch himself.\nWho could do it better?\nHow about Jim Carey? Mike Meyers? Sasha Baron Cohen? Geez, Mel Brooks did just voicework for Hotel Transylvania 3 this year and the guys 92 years old.

The fade ins and fade outs to make this movie look “magical” is fucking fake and is getting really old.\n\nStop remaking your classics and start making NEW ONES with original ideas. I’ve had it, I’m fucking fed up with you and this god awful monopoly you’ve built. Fox, Marvel, Star Wars, you need to back the fuck off.

They are always 100% more original than what you’ve become within the past 3 fucking years (yeah no shit they do sequels, they gotta make money, but either way, you have to admit that they put more work into their films than these live action adaptations that are being pumped out YEARLY by the numbers since it’s a trend to follow Marvel studios and the MCU’s style of filmmaking).\n\nBut holy Christ have I had it. I’m sure people will start doing the same if they’d just wake up and open their eyes. But seriously though, Disney, stop it. Do what you do best with animation and creating ORIGINAL stories and content (don’t even get me started on what you do with your parks, because you’re just fucking idiots when it comes to that and disrespectful).

Well, I can\'t blame people for messing up my easy indian name if they can\'t say "Alla-Dean." That might not be how it is spelled, but that is how you see Alladin correctly in the orignal way.

Why can\'t we have any actors from the countries I\'ve mention above play these characters. My cousin is a actor and in England, his Indian look are accepted and he is in shows. I\'d wish these actors looked more like me. I never see actors in American movies look like me, dark skined, dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, and deep voices.
