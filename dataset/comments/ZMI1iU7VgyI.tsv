Daffy	To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Louis Cole. The vibe is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical rhythm most of the flow will go over a typical listeners head. There's also Louis' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his lyrics - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Nas' discography, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his flow, to realize that they're not just bars- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Louis Cole truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the beauty in J's existential catchphrase "I own an entire fucking blimp" which itself is a cryptic reference to Nas' epic Illmatic. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Louis Cole's genius unfolds itself on their stereo speakers. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Louis Cole tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
