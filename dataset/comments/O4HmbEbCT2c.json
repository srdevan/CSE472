California property taxes are much lower than the rest of the country, but depending upon the assessed value, it could still be lofty sum. 3. You will have much higher operating costs on a yacht, but the expenses to maintain a house like this will be quite high as well. 4. With all of these maintenance and annual expenses, the performance of real estate shouldn’t be compared to investing in the stock market, not to mention that unloading an asset like a house that lists for over $150 million will most likely take quite some time, and these types of homes usually sell for well below list price, and you will still have to pay capital gains tax, assuming you made money off the sale. 4. The values stated for a lot of the items are vastly overinflated. That’s not a $4 million dollar Bugatti. \n\nI could continue, but you get the point.

I even have an indoor waterfall/rock formation that flows into a koi pond (which I didn't see in this $188 Million dollar home) and my cousin and my sister helped me to do it (I saw it on a you tube video and I wanted my own version of it) my lot cost me $85K for 1.8 Acres and my home is 3,600 sq.ft. with a 1,200 sq.ft. Lower level and my home cost $750K (so including the lot & some other things) = $850k total... I have 4 bd.rms 2 full bathrooms & 2 half baths (there's a master bath, and a main bathroom, a half bath on the first floor and another half bath in the lower level) and all of my bedrooms are on the second floor (I'm not a fan of first floor master bedrooms) and I have gorgeous natural views of the metroparks in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio... (I'm a realtor & I flip houses in case people want to know what I do for a living to be able to afford to have my own home built) and at 32! I consider it a major accomplishment and I did it all for LESS THAN $1 MILLION dollars (my home is gorgeous and I love it!) and then I see THIS! for $188 MILLION! WOW!!!... this house is worth MAYBE $50 MILLION! (at the most!) AND THAT'S INCLUDING ALL THE FURNITURE & DECOR!

One, the people he mentioned aren\'t the types of people to purchase a monstrosity like this. Two, give me the option of one of those yachts or this... I\'d choose the yacht every day (I\'d even be willing for my main residence to be a shed if it meant keeping the yacht) Three, they don\'t depreciate as much as he said, many of them selling for more than their build cost years after completion. Four, you can\'t move a house (at least one like this) to almost anywhere in the world like you can with a yacht. But also, Mark Cuban has never owned a yacht, the yacht that people think he owns is Fountainhead, Edward Lampert owns it, Mark chartered it once, it\'s also not worth $350 million, not even half of that in fact. Octopus (Paul Allen\'s yacht) would have cost no more than $200-250 million to build, not the $400 million stated, he also clearly isn\'t aware that Paul Allen unfortunately died. I could go on and on here but I can\'t be bothered. For a representative selling at this level... He hasn\'t got a lot of knowledge, either that or he is deliberately lying and exaggerating. I personally don\'t think this will ever sell, not for anywhere near listing anyway, I think it\'ll become yet another enormous LA leasing property that people like Dan Bilzerian will rent. The "Bel Air Circuit" he mentioned is basically Prima, which is available to anyone (who can afford it) $35,000 set up fee, the primary owner has to be there any time it\'s being used for fingerprint identification, $500 for every movie viewed after that, so if your kids want to watch the same movie 5 time\'s, get ready for a shocking bill. The fact that they\'re allowing a YouTube tour is also very telling. I don\'t know if it\'s him who knows far too little or me who knows far too much from working for people who live this kind of lifestyle... But if I were Bruce (the developer) I would not want this guy representing my property.', 'Lewis Atkinson': "I guess money can't buy good taste.
