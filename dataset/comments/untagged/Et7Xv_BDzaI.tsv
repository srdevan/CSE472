Cesar Ferreira	The EXACT same thing happened to me in FUT Champs matt. Lose last second to BS
Danny Keane	Martial
Jordan Williams	good videos but hardly surprising that you have a 1.7 million coin player when you routinely spend £70 on pack openings. While its nice to see you guys play with players normal people wouldn't get a chance to play, it would also be nice to see you guys have a more balanced output. Maybe have another account dedicated to spending less and only using rewards packs? I honestly think your best FIFA videos were at the start when it was actually exciting when you got a new good player for your team. Now you get Gerrard and I'm just like that's cool I guess, no doubt he will be changed for another icon in a couple of videos time.  Also if you are going down the route of investing loads of money, at least switch it up. have multiple squads that are more unique and diverse rather than just pursuing an all icon team
