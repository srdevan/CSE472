Terence Greebz	Eat me. At. Un
Don Jindra	Turns out it was bad math. Some surprise.
eismcsquared	I now believe we are merely ‘Stardust Mites’ munching on carbon and converting it into entropy. It is our universal task and we are doing a great job.   Munch away peeps hope is a fools game
Old Frugal One Hyper-Drive Movement	CO2 is plant food!!! We are not warming. The Modern Warm Period ended in 2016. We are diving into a Grand Solar Minimum. We will have much wilder weather patterns as the jet streams go out of whack. Crop loses are happening now due to cold and snow, rain and flooding, and droughts. The ice sheets are growing at record pace at both poles. Get real! It's time to prepare.
Luxiano Valdez	This is totally incorrect!!! Guys, have you ever heard of a Grand Solar Minimum??? We are entering a Global Cooling Period. The IPCC agenda is not to help humanity, but the rationing & control of Energy. Do Your On Research. That report has been shown to have a outrageous Math error by  Nic Lewis of Princeton University & corroborated by many other researchers   https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-11-07/major-math-error-puts-widely-cited-global-warming-study-ice  If you truly want to have the latest & Real Scientific assessment of our climate reality I recommend u reading the research papers by Solar physicists  Valentina Zharkova
Lone Wolf	Get a clue  there are many dozen feedbacks ALREADY happening and there is not a FKN thing that can be done to slow or reverse any of them.  Some problems may have solutions but predicaments always have consequences (outcomes).  Welcome to the Age of Consequences Mofo.  Bye bye bipeds.

David Darby	The earth is warming and ice is melting and its not human caused.
GhostwriterDoF	The situation is dire, indeed... yet, take heart, our stalwart Champions of Reason (that means you, Jimmy, Stef, Nellie and noticeably absent, Ron), all is not yet lost. Shall we put it to the “great visionary titans” of this age? Is this environment of ecological and economic disasters the best that they can do, all that they have to offer Humanity? More tax cuts for the rich and deregulation to enrich themselves at everyone else’s (and their own in the end) expense?  It’s time for all these “great-thinkers”, these “power-elites” who run the hedge funds, the investment banks, the CEO’s, billionaires, “Journalists” and media Moguls, Politicians and Jurists, to show us if they can rise to the occasion to address these most significant challenges of our age, perhaps in all of our storied human history, or step aside to allow others who can.   What answers and solutions do they, the “greatest” minds of this age, of Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, Oxford, indeed, all these Ivy League and lesser celebrated institutions, among their educators and alumni, the Executive and Civic elite, with all of their collective genius, what do they propose for us?   We do have billions of people to lend a hand, so we have the “man-power” to address the issues we face in a matter of decades (restoring habitats, reclaiming wildlands, remaking the cities we live in more “green”). We have new technology that may be repurposed to aid us in our efforts, and there is plenty of wealth to fund and turn things around.   For starters, with all the excess sea water, we should probably be investing heavily in desalinization plants that produce energy, don’t you think? Also, water pipelines to reclaim some of our vast desert areas for agricultural production?   We may only need to cut out about 40% of the meat production. This can be done by banning corporate “farms” and institute free-roam raising cattle, dairy, and poultry farms. We can set aside enough land to roam the herds/flocks and integrate them into sustainable habitats, replenishing resources by controlled harvests. If we are efficient with distribution (we throw away millions of tons of food, needlessly wasted), (actual) consumption may only go down about 10 to 20% (perhaps a little more or less).   We can do the same with sea-fare food resources through controlled harvests, 5 to 7 year fishing moratoriums in certain areas (agreed upon by the competing World Powers). The greed-stricken out there pursue the unnecessary inevitability for the fish to be driven to extinction, hoping for their million-dollar-tuna. Instead we can have a successive half-million-dollar-tuna every 10 years (estimated) when the cycle of moratoriums kicks in. Once the sea life replenishes, we can reduce the time to let them restock, but keep in place the system.   Similar things can be done by allocating large acreage areas for wood harvests, (various types of trees in temporary habitats, on the edges of natural forests) for basic (re)building materials. It will take time for these areas to produce on a large scale but, in a few decades, they will be sustainable indefinitely with proper management. There are many things we can do.   What do you think Jimmy, Nellie, Stef, will the “Masters of the Privileged rigged Universe” let the light of Human consciousness go out, along will all life as we know it, on this our Earth, just so they can get that next solid gold, jewel encrusted toilet seat for every bathroom in their house, or their 10nth yacht or private jet, or their 10nth private island?   You know, with billions of people comes billions of minds that can come together to solve problems, each with their own perspectives, many with unique ways of looking at things that we might not think of ourselves...
suzannecernyart	I HAVE TO PUT ICEPACKS ON MY OIL PAINT TUBES TO KEEP THEM FROM DRYING OUT IN THE HEAT (IN NOVEMBER).
Tim Cross	When this doesn't happen, what then? Al Gore told us if we didn't face the inconvenient truth, we would have ice free arctic oceans years ago. We put out far more carbon than we were projected to and yet the ice is still there and will increase during this solar minimum. Warm is better than frozen. Ask any living thing.
Yatukih001	So let me get it right. Something that is not man made is way worse than anybody thought. In other words the left want to steal money from my pockets...and that means the Jimmy Dore show is whining over money....
Tom Datsall	As long as actor George Hamilton is alive and well and absorbing half the sun’s radiation....earth will be fine!
Gary Johnson	Nice to see another person who has his priorities right...:-)
BiketripsETC	Just the tip of the iceberg. Hear the talk  ”Ocean Apocalypse“ by Jeremy  Jackson. On YouTube. But get ready, cause it is hard on your optimism.
Mass Extinction	We are at 7c you dumb ass 😣
Steven Brosius	People need to find balance... Try listening to the opposing view..... Do some research yourself instead of buying into that the mainstream feed us to keep us scared.... Get a balanced view. There are two sides to every argument. Or do most people just want to believe the worst.... ? That being said. We should all look after our planet. But we should no spend our lives worrying because of what we ate told is going to happen. Don't be a sheep.  Research.
dARB rENFPOH	A man at Starbucks wanted a mug, the barista poured his drink into the mug then threw out the 2 tall cups, and that’s what’s wrong with the west. We are downright wasteful!

mocretich	The documentary is about the brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado and it's called "The Salt of the Earth"
stephane paulin	Please take notice that global warming is not real , it is a scam invented by mean people to use the environment as a mean of touching and manipulating a majority of people to bow down to the biggest fraud that was ever invented . And steal the money to finance themselfes from the pokets of the millions of people that live with theyr lie and cant fight them in court beeing too poor.
eric jones	Vegan for the animals and for the climate and definitely for my health, best thing I ever did
PanjuTorials	The problem is our consumption. Buying  a new phone every year. Buying a new car every five years. Eating meat excessivly. In general, buying more than we need.  All of that stuff needs to be produced, producing goods creates heat and CO².   It's easy to say, all the big companies should change, but in the end it is all on us, the comsumers to change anything. If you don't buy their stuff, they have to change what they offer. If you don't like what a company does, don't buy their stuff.
Bengal Warrior	Its good in the long run. World is overpopulated. Its negative check bu mother nature. Once 25 percnt population goes away we can live in peace. I wish middle east turns from desert to hot hot hot desert and goes under sea.
Yehia Abdelrahman	Her voice is so soothing ❤️
Sharon Sampson	Is this video about GLOBAL WARMING?  Climate change?  Pfft.  Safe label.  Of course there is climate change and right now, since 2008 we've been in a Grand Solar Minimum.  A 206 year like clockwork sorta, cycle with tons of information about what happens during a regular Grand Solar Minimum.  If the people 206 years ago knew that we oh so modern and pampered and educated humans would blow off the nightmare they had to endure because of a blatant lie, they are rolling over in their graves.  You idiots that believe in global warming have absolutely nothing to go by other than mimicking this propaganda Gore's professor started and tried to turn around. Gore, whooo hooo!  A,  D student, unbelievable what intelligent healthy people will believe.   This Grand Solar Minimum is named the Eddy Minimum; the others names of recent GSMs are Maunder and Dalton and Centennial.  Check out the earthquake and volcanic activity that happens during these GSMs.    There is absolutely no global warming however they try to sell it.  Unbelievable how gullible we humans have become!  So...easy.
Kent Hoyt	It's over. I'm glad to be 45 and not 5 years old. It's about to get real. There will be hundreds of millions killed as those in ruined areas flood into regions still rich and habitable, and those luckier people killing as many refugees as possible to try and keep what they have.
1972martind28	I don’t know where you’re getting your data but it’s false. The sun is getting weak in a grand solar minimum. TSI levels are dropping extremely fast and cosmic ray levels are extremely high, The earth has cooled .6°C in the last two years
david smith	This gave All Gore a hard on..Now he will be making millions more off this climate scam .o
Dagoberto Garcia	Lol wasting time to watch this video. We're dying anyway
Craig With a Wig	We won't ever rebuild the energy grid of this world, because oil rules the world. And everytime someone finds a replacement for fossil fuels, they end up mysteriously dead.
Gary Lucas	WOLVERIIIIINES!
C C	Instead we have Bolsonaro in Brazil already selling off what's left of the rain forest and Trump selling off public land and the arctic to energy corporations and Trudeau here in Canada buying oil pipelines & increasing tanker traffic to ports in Vancouver, putting a delicate eco system here in the North Pacific in complete danger. We have whales who are teetering on extinction and they are increasing the traffic of oil tankers in the area just to sell a little bit more fracked, shitty oil to China.  We deserve extinction, total and utter extermination of the scummy human virus that infests this beautiful planet.
Daniel Rasmussen	It is such a strange feeling, knowing you're causing your own extinction and yet not caring at all.
Jon Bain	Only real solution is no more than 1 child each.
Stephen Worley	Check the ice volume in the Arctic:  http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/icethickness/thk.uk.php It's the same now as it was ten years ago in 2008.  The warming has stopped.  Check for yourself. Ice is increasing in the Antarctic.  What you're hearing in this video is political propaganda from the IPCC. Don't believe this hoax.  We're not as stupid as they think.  All this alarmism is complete fraud. The IPCC climate model has overestimated the temperature.  Many scientists are adjusting their models because they have failed:  http://notrickszone.com/2017/10/16/recent-co2-climate-sensitivity-estimates-continue-trending-towards-zero/#sthash.qyhCHmbR.Ry3z67pI.dpbs
technically observant	you are so gullable you beleive anything  i live in the northern climate we just had one of the longest & coldest springs & now the coldest septembers & octobers we have had in many decades .go & look up what the real climatologist & what they say about the false climate change .if the scientist do not agree with the government the loose there funding .2 degrees  incress in temperature will  not melt the poles  warmer temps. in the northern hemisphere will be a good thing .there are fewer hurricanes now then ever before  .back in early 1900s there was a huricane that wiped ou a city in texas & killed 10,000 people .they never rebuilt that city

elvis manhattan	DOSE ANYONE HERE INCLUDING JIMMY KNOWS THAT POLES SHIFT? NORTH POLE IS ALREADY 5DEGREESE TO EAST!   Its called magnetic shifting of the poles, earth is 99% liquids you dumb fucks!  i love how G.Carlin said ''saving the planet are this people fucking sane? we cant take care of our selfs and we're gonna save the fucking planet?''
Katie K.	You are all dumb. The whole solar system is heating up I guess that’s our fault too. It couldn’t be that the sun is hotter. Yep just tax the shit out of us. You also know why this is bullshit? Plowing puts more CO2 in the air than anything we do, but you don’t hear anyone talk about stopping the plow. Nope just the meat industry. People will fall for anything. Every ten years they throw out these predictions.

CyberRonin	Glad i don't have kids. Their lives would be absolute shit.
weebo	makes since why so many billionaires are trying to develop the tech necessary to colonize Mars now.   Its not that they're trying to save themselves and live there.  They're trying to get it to the point where they can get their kids their generation landed there.
A LdR	The photographer is a Brazilian named Salgado, the film is by Wim Wenders
Colin Watson	Objectively  ... what are his sources he is quoting ? Is he a research scientist ? Or simply just a  hearsay messenger ?      On the screen it says  INTELLIGENCE. It's not its information only  blah  which requires processing  and the source verified  to turn into intelligence.  Otherwise  were nothing more than chimps screaming .
Tom Ulcak	Is Jimmy Dore the other 'stakeholder' that Niko D. House is speaking of?   Very important development.  Take a look.  justnform.com has been created by those who are sick and tired of censorship by Facebook, Twitter and Google.  Censoring, manipulating and banning by these platforms is anti-freedom.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=17&v=UzNSow5ysjk
Bill Conger	If anthropogenic global warming was a real thing there is no way to stop it short of exterminating humans.. you know like the Nazis did .. gas chambers..camps.. ovens etc etc.. eating lettuce under a windmill in a Prius isn’t going to halve Co2. Jimmy is correct about one thing.. people aren’t going to upend human civilization to lower Co2 .05% .
Marico Fialdini	There’s no global warming it’s a crock of crap
The Why Perspective	if this is true why are tech company's make new phones every year or car company's making new cars every year. why isn't product exchange drawn out to 3 or 5 or 7 or even 10 year cycles...oh ya, because this is a load of BS. I hope your getting paid well to pitch this non-sense. I find it amazing that these environmentalist would rather see the west burn in a suicide praising of the environment instead of addressing the issues of manufacturing...because its BS. its carbon, now its plastic. Just be honest this is renewable energy (electric) in a war on oil. you wanna save the world go back to burning oil to power your home.
Joe Parr	We NEED a thanos snap right about now
Michele Fiorese	"Then why am I cold?"  - Trump supporters
Matthieu Vonlanthen	This is great. The world need to be cleansed.
Denis Nadeau	I know this is going to sound crazy and you'd be right to think so but for the sake of the planet's future: There's actually a solution to all this if it does get out of hand... If we were to nuke YS, it would erupt and create years of possible winters, thus reshaping our icecaps! Yes, NA would be devastated and the world population around the globe would drop due to famine etc..., but with some survivor skills, the world would go on and maybe for the better.
agun17	Trump pulled out? I thought he rammed it in further, although to be fair it probably not that much of a difference.
Rox Pozz	My personal opinion is that the global warming in not caused by men  .... the increasing of cosmic rays cause the increase of emission of CO2 from the center of the earth. There is not solutions and  if the Galactic cosmic rays continuing to increase the temperature may reach level where the life on earth disappears completely....
Kristian K	You have the power to do something substancial today, directly, and not wait for politicians action or permission: you can exclude animal products from your diet. Compared to reworking the worlds power system, going vegan seems like a pretty simple thing to do.
ANDYEPIC	Hurry Elon
jar josh	This guy doesn't know anything about real climate science. He just spreads the propaganda. Early sea ice in the arctic closing ports in Canada. Of course he won't report that. They had to airlift supplies off the ships that got stuck in it so they could have enough fuel to keep warm through the winter.
Sean Cushman	Jimmy you have half the picture. Now if you open your other eye you may see the whole picture. The IPCC is one of those things you need to look into. Stop believing what you read in the media and see what the actual scientist have to say. Not the paid shills or the people seeking funding for their research. Don’t stress yourself, if you look at NASA’s data the ice sheet has grown and not shrunk. Don’t believe me, go look at NASA’s data on their website. You are being lied to and you are thanking them for the shit sandwich they have fed you! Do some real research please. You have a platform that could help the world! I agree with a lot of your thoughts on the two parties. I am glad Hilary lost. The democrats screwed themselves as I believe Bernie would have beat Trump but so many of his supporters didn’t and would never vote for Hillary! Just please do some research and look at the data not what someone is telling you, FACTS matter!

FlagFlyingHigh3	Oh man this all blowing up within a month of the elections and immigration blowing up in the news. Both are stunts
Jann D	Oh jimmy, we don't need to get to 4 degrees to activate the feedback loops, they've already started. As the permafrost melts more every year it releases untold amounts of stored methane that will drastically increase the rate of warming. It's already to late, the wealthy have driven us to extinction and they all know it, they're all buying land in New Zealand to hunker down on while the rest of us did.
autohmae	Actually, we are rebuilding our current energy infrastructure already. Look at electric cars and look at solar and wind. It's only getting cheaper and the adoption is accelerating. Coal is already dead, petroleum is next on the list. Why ? Because it makes economic sense because it's cheaper that's why it's happening.
I sell air	Fear mongering. Earth has been through way worse. Humans may not survive, but climate change is no major threat to life as a whole.
Peatey	We're fucked
Teemu M.	America is great. It can´t be touched by climate change. Rock´n´roll!
Ralph Macchio	Why is it that the people who are screaming about climate change are the same idiots who want open borders and uncontrolled immigration. I'm in Australia and we've just got to 25,000,000 people we were not supposed to get there until 2050! But it's 2018 and we are building a big Australia no matter what. All the while smashing down trees destroying the natural environment to make room for more people. And at the same time building renewable energy infrastructure that doesn't work and drives energy prices up. Putting more people under the poverty line.  Population is directly correlated to all environmental impacts including global warming. Population control is the easiest cheapest way to affect the environment in a positive way. But the talking heads do and say nothing. I've read a hell of a lot about Global Warming and I believe the people who are pushing it are either stupid, liars or misinformed. Control populations. The western world needs to lead by example. Sustain current populations and teach the third world how to control theirs. Help them sustain a population the correlates to the environment they live in. Anything else is utter rubbish. We can't just keep adding people. Wake up, the globalists, the banks, the politicians have created a ponzi scheme that will end in destruction. They add more people and they reap the benefits of a cheaper labour force, politicians books look better but in the long run it'll all come crashing down. Our kids will inherit a dump. Population is key. Global warming is a sham, a distraction from a much bigger game. Diversity is what the ideologues have been brainwashed with. To just add more and more people to an environment that is already busting at the seems.
Gee Kay	the hippies and yippies warned us back in the 60's but sadly became yuppies and paradise was lost
fiziwig	The human species is inherently flawed. It simply can't pass the fitness test for long term survival. What can we do about it? Nothing. Species that aren't fit go extinct, and the human species is not fit. It is what it is. We won't be missed.
cc360	4.5 billion years of climate change.. Life has been wiped out a few times on earth. Man had nothing to do with it then and man will not be able to stop earth from changing its clmate naturally now by throwing our currancy at it.. It's a hoax folks. You might hate my comment now, but in 30 years when nothing has happened, please like my comment then. 🍻

Ellis Lagres	why even try to stop it at this point? i mean look at this place. i know you all might think things are okay or not so bad in regards to the way we live, but really look at for just a second. it's to the point where you can't even present objective reality and have it even be considered in some cases. just let it happen. we had our chance to be something great and failed because of the indifference of you ignorant shits that would rather play pretend then grow.
Pete Gordon	Sooo I saw on some other video that at this rate the world will warm 4 degrees in 7 years...
WillMcmichael	Thank god there are comprehensive videos like this
Holly	7:25 spot-on!
err0r0b0	November 1st was hot as fuck. Republicans deny global warming, while Reptilians cuck them out with footlong shlongs. White women are screaming MDMA, and they never lie.
Dutch Flats	Blame China, India, and the developing nations, they're the ones increasing their use of coal!
Larry Maggard	So everybody dies except people in the north; white people
Troy Davis	The World has no idea what is coming! The clear fact to stop Climate Change is so dramatic that that the extinction of mankind is assured! You do not want to know how to cure the world.
Dutch Hiker	The worst case is global runaway warming. Essentially turning the Earth into Venus which has a surface temperature of 872f due to a thick cloud around it that traps the heat..sounds familiar?(https://www.space.com/18526-venus-temperature.html) Feedback loops reinforce each other. And if you have no exit clause in the loop the loop will keep running :) Our exit clause was about 30 years ago. We ignored it.
Dave Joyce	This is literally the dumbest article ever written. The hysteria is absurd. Completely rebuild the entire energy infrastructure, our agriculture, and our diet? Will never happen, and if anyone tries (cough cough, Bernie), talk about a gut punch to the poor and working class Americans.
Lao Mark	Jimmy, you are correct, we are NOT going the do the radical changes absolutely necessary to avoid a "hell on Earth" across the world in the next 10-20 (max). We are doomed  but the Elite already  high tech confortável bunker ready for them in New Zealand. Just the end of this current cycle, like it happened several times in the Planet's history...
Kate D	I don't get how some Americans can still not believe in climate change. You guys have NASA saying its real for crying out loud. NASA! These experts have an entire section dedicated to monitoring and explaining climate change. If anyone has the technology, knowledge and expertise to monitor and analyze what is going on with the friggin planet... you'd think its these guys of all people! Yet somehow some are still believing the words of some random politicians claiming ''oh its all fake, I should know!'' and completely dismiss friggin NASA??? Really now? You really think some random Joe that clearly has no scientific background (and happens to have worked for this or that oil company) should be believed over some of the most brilliant minds the country has... who happen to have all the right tools and expertise one needs to say if climate change is real or not? Unfortunately genuine credibility accounts for nothing anymore apparently.
SD Photography	I don't think a lot of these scientists take into consideration the 'methane bomb'. The Arctic ocean has been releasing methane all summer (2018) and is still releasing methane as of Oct. 30, 2018. It is accelerating. Instead of having decades to correct this we actually have years.
Tim Newth	There are two upright paths, work on inner spirituality or hold the elites accountable for ecocide.
Ole Siebel	Boy i sure love being born into a world that is already fucked
42shoes	When people quit driving, and start turning down the thermostat then I will believe we're serious.
Skinnymarks	Is this a solution to the fermi paradox?
T T	This is not scepticism.. But they come out with this report immediately after the United States pulled out and then pulled funding. Just seems fishy.. The ones being funded for research needs to keep it going to keep the flow of money. The people saying no climate change is funding themselves and have compelling arguments. Argument sake if climate change is not happening what do those scientists  do? Where do they now get paid? How do they survive? Have to keep the flow of funds going. No?
highcc	You've confused feedback loop, which is already happening, with runaway global warning, which occurred in Venus.
Dark Glass	I'm starting to think we might have to go nuclear and cause Nuclear Winter to counteract Climate change.
Marcus Ulmer	Nellie is a low talker
Steve	Why do libs believe this stuff? Aren't you sick of the end of the world predictions every decade?
Lisa Robin	I didn't graduate college/havent taken a math class since I was required to in high school to graduate 12 years ago maybe 15 I cant even fucking count that and just learned what the van allen belts(belt?) were last week but couldn't someone way fucking smarter than me stop the increase global warming appocalyptic doom with some kind of engineering shit or nucleer shit there? Someone smarter then me needs to figure this out. I am dissapointed by how much we are blaming ourseeves for global warming though. I am too fucking sick with chronic/termail illness bullshit and am vegan myself and everything Jimmy talks about here positively, but with only so few years left to change things for humanity to survive we have to think big picture and lean on our scientists and engineers and not our need to blame ourselves for our deeply flawped culture that the west has infected the east with, I guess capitalism is the word I'm looking for. seriously someone smarter than me look into the van allen belts. I am literally wasting away in a fucking hospital bed somehow I learned about them in a fucking siezure.  We as humans are so sad desperate to blame ourselves for what is coming which is so very human of us and we are missing the chance to open our eyes and look at the earth's history and patterns and see how it would have ended humanity before had we existed previously. Of course the best thing for regular shit people like me is to still be vegan do all the fucking smart shit on a personal level just rambling about  about science meaningless shit becauseI have encephalophy and am going to forget that I wrote this bullshit in about two seconds so I get a pass for writing this bullshit and it making no sense
peter sharpe	No time left?
AimlessRobin	When shit starts to collapse I’m just gonna kill myself
wijaya47	as long as people have their FREEDOM, nothing else matters.  Anyways I'm going to heaven so why should my beautiful mind care???
Benjamin	The Club of Rome manufactured climate change under Agenda 21. It’s just another way to create a common enemy in a post war world to for the elite control your mind and your wallet.
Ebon Collins	Up is simply up and down or downward will never be up. The earth is not a ball.
justinred	Being on the left or being on the right is equally disgusting. Neither one makes you a better or more morally sound person. Actually it means the opposite. Each person should have a moral compass that knows right from wrong and how people should be treated. If you're a decent person how could you ever align yourself with Democrats or Republicans? How can you defend their terrible behavior?
Gunnar Landin	Total bshit. These numbers are just made up, no-one can forsee the climate. Way to accurate numbers to be true. Mankind will eventually die but not the way these people predicts.
Mike Earussi	Don't worry, nothing is going to turn out all right.    Human Nature refuses to accept anything it doesn't want to hear. By the time the effects of Global Warming become so bad that even the most stubborn accept it, it will be too late. Unfortunately, those are the very people who have the most power to change things. So we're all dead, possibly within 20 or 30 years. So just enjoy the rest of your life as much as possible.
brentkn smith	I really wish TYT would report on Global Warming more. Unfortunately they don't, They may report more than other mainstream news media but when it comes right down to it, TYT is a political news station. You are not going to get people out of a burning building by casually saying there is a fire in the building once or twice and then talking about last night's hockey scores or what Donald Trump was doing with an umbrella. TYT instead focuses on trivial things design to distract the public from the danger of Global Warming. If they would only give the subject of Global Warming as much air time as they do the political mumbo jumbo then maybe people would finally WAKE THE FUCK UP.
Justin Noker	Well guys we had a nice run. See you all in the afterlife!
Lugmillord	This year's heat wave in Germany was already horrible. I'm really scared.
Mi G	Global warming seems to scale up. Fresh news:  End of the world by 2020.
Bob Marley	Global warming is a complete scam with doctored data. Don't you know this? Why would you believe these doctored-data clowns? I am way more worried about about all the poison they dropping on us. Fukushima radiation will be destroying the pacific for a thousand years and there is evidence that they did it on purpose. Chem-trails are real.
Sim Salabim	Actually, if we never began eating plants, there would still be forests everywhere, because we would not need to destroy them to create wheat fields and the population would not have exploded! Zoom into any place on Earth, it's all agricultural fields.
King Koopa	i just hope everyone who doesnt give a shit about climate change mostly seems to be older people. hope they live long enough to see what they caused!! what i feel will happen is they will all die before they see what they did and therefore feel no remorse or stupidity.     yes i am petty AF
Mark Meyers	Jimmy is falling for the words of corrupt bodies (UN/IPCC).  This is really global carbon govt.  Now put it into perspective.  90% of greenhouse gasses are water vapor.  CO2 is a fraction of the remaining amount.  I've listened to climate pros ballpark the current CO2 contribution to warming at maybe 1/100th of a degree (but guessing is the only option on earth today).  Recall historical weather data: 0.8C change from 1880 to 2012, and the curves don't correspond with industrial outputs in that period.  That is too easily within a natural and mundane variability.    Back in 2000, Al Gore made some predictions that were wildly off.  People claim the oil companies knew about warming in the 70s, but how could they have had the science to be correct (when nobody else does)?  Current climate modeling involves a small number of variables when monitoring limited ecosystems; we don't have the global modeling science at this time.  If someone says they know, they're lying.  The UN and the IPCC must be lying to know.   For me, the real tragedy with this corrupted push for global carbon govt is to ignore all the skulls and crossbones that we presently suffer from, like fracking wastewater, or hexavalent chromium, or, however oddly, aeresolized aluminum, or mercury, lead, sodium fluoride, and many other things that are killing us and giving us cancer and which are bad for all life they come in contact with.  We don't talk about these things; we talk about carbon.   Listen to Freeman Dyson or others - there is a compilation of some videos on the 1000frolly channel, here, to get counter points of view, with some discussion, on this topic.  I agree with the alleged 97% who agree in what I'm saying.  Anthropogenic warming is real.  But perhaps saying so is also quite clever?
Jan-Paul Sun	i think the only thing we can do is prepare for the worst, no water, to much heat, drought whatever. more debate about this is more in trend of probably its coming, we just don't know how. So lets prepare.
Lecherous Lizard	A month ago it was 1.5°C. Amazing how quickly the climate changes. A this rate Earth will turn into Venus by 2030.
Andrew Schuschu	Great Filter at work- its amazing that we're a species that doesnt look at one another and see each other as the same species and thus work as one to protect itself
Edward Yang	Reforestation is definitely doable and practical. They've done it in China. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RqsUD6fyGk

G Mallory	ride a bike.      fuel/insurance budget  OR!  beer/ice cream budget;)
DEUCE	A Question for all the climate change deniers: why would the government lie to us in that matter? Most of you say that the government wants to control people with fear or some shit but thats soooo much garbage lmfao. 99% of people are aware of climate change and still dont give a fuck. Nice control^^
Dave Thomas	They think it's all over well it is  now!!!
Scott Baker	Seaweed will eliminate >70% of cow methane. Getting rid of soot is more effective, faster, and WAY cheaper than getting rid of CO2.  It's not hopeless!  https://www.opednews.com/Quicklink/Is-the-Big-Insane-Ask-easi-in-Sci_Tech-Agreement_Black-Soot_Carbon-Reduction_Future-181013-586.html

N Capos	I’m SOOO glad I’m not younger!
Brian Bennett	Spot on Jimmy.
MARS TV CHANNEL	HE DOESN'T GET IT THAT THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE GLOBAL ELITE AGENDA TO PUSH GLOBAL WARMING WHICH IS A TOTAL FORCE AND FRAUD IT WAS A FRAUD FROM THE START WHEN THEIR GURU AL GORE CAME TO PRESENT THE HOCKEY STICK GRAPH WHICH IS A COMPLETE FRAUD AND WHICH WAS PUT TOGETHER BY MICHAEL MANN AND THE SCANDALS THEY JUST PILED UP AND UP AND UP THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE SCANDALS RELATING TO A SINGLE ISSUE THAN WITH AGW. THE REAL GENOCIDE IS HAPPENING NOW IN YEMEN, AND   THE REALLY URGENT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE IGNORED WHILE PUSHING THIS FAKE BULLSHIT. Besides that there are 17 times more people dying right now at this present time from cold okay then from heat, AND according to NASA the planet has become greener because of higher CO2 levels. This means Greater Harvests translate two more yes much more food the world around for the people in poor countries, and well of course that's totally not done if you ask the elite; they don't want poor people to get more developed and less hungry. Furthermore, A SIDE EFFECT OF A GREENER EARTH IS THAT THE PLANET STARTS COOLING. To check for yourself just plant a few more trees in your garden and see how much it cools off in the summer. The only places where it has been getting hotter are the fcking metropolises - concrete baby. And air conditioning units, millions of car engines running, air-conditioned office building vents, and by the way that's where most thermometers to measure the surface temperature are placed, near and on top and around those buildings in cities that blow hot air outwards - not in remote areas where temperature is not affected by artificial heat sources. So the data is completely skewed for starters. Thermometers they use to measure surface temperatures, which is then fed to their climate software to create climate models are disproportionately put in urban areas that are naturally of course hotter because of the heat pollution, while very few are placed in remote areas like in the middle of a fcking ocean, or even in the Arctic sea for instance. another thing the South Pole has been expanding its ice coverage now for almost a decade and significantly, also according to NASA baby, except for West Antarctica where it is melting but guess what? There's a fcking volcano sitting under the ice cap there. Same goes for Greenland there are parts of Greenland which sit on top of geothermal hot spots baby. WRONG DATA IN BABY MEANS WRONG DATA OUT!
Hamilton Rodgers	Relax, Trump say's there no such thing as global warming.
Dennis Renner	Governments, corporations and economic markets chose short term profits, over long term humanity.
James Niland.	The IPCC report is still not alarmist though. They are still conservative with this.

B20C0	I'm actually glad that I might see this piece of shit of a species go down.
Flavius Belisarius	Plato said 2500 years ago that to keep slaves docile you should not feed them meat but bread and grains. But yeah, beleieve the Rockefeller foundations and others that pay for this stuff and keep eating grains.  The very same stuff that gives you wheat belly that keeps you full of illness-causing candida and gives you auto-immune diseases up the ying-yang, you stupid peasants.
zackery zackery	Actually, the climate change forecast models have been wrong in the past and these current forecasts are largely driven by politics.  The fact that climate change is happening, However, there is a lack of conclusive scientific data to fully support the link between carbon output and climate change. Add in the fact that climate change is highly politicized and pushed by globalists , completely undermines the real research that needs to be done to continue to monitor and study the causes behind climate change.     These forecast models, which most insiders in the research world will tell you are spiked with erroneous "parameters" , are largely hyped in order to support the political movement and maintain research grant money.   The problem with fake news and fake science is that people aren't as stupid as you think.
ADerpyReality	What is worse than climate change genocide?
stapme	THIS JUST IN.... It's better than we thought.... There is no warming.
donnie fiechtner	CO2 is not the problem, All climate models that have been created have failed to accurately predict change in either direction. Even the term global warming had to be tweaked to climate change, just like the numbers in the climate models.The planet has the ability to self regulate, which is why the models don't predict with enough accuracy to say one way or another. Perfect for funneling tons of taxpayers money into parts unknown.
Vaughn Gainey	Wow, we're fucked.
Sil Mov	Very informative video
Jupiter rising	This guy is wrong!  It's way worse than they are letting on, the level he is saying how bad it will get, will be here within 3 to 6 years from NOW!  We are already at around 1.6c over base. The true base line is the 1750s, they move the goal posts. They have also not considered almost any self reinforcing feedback loops, Effect form Methane, x100 worse than Co2, The feedback loops are happening NOW, not in 10 or 20 years. We will have a blue ocean event next winter at the N, pole, When that happens it  will spin out of control so fast it will make your head spin. WAIT AND SEE!  If they stopped all carbon tomorrow, within about 2 or 3 months the global temp would further jump around 3 to 5c  = possible 6.6c + within that time line. WE ARE ALL SCREWED. The 6th mass extinction is well underway.

Guido Bächi	A real problem is pollution!! That is made by human. We should try the atmost to reduce plastic etc. Concerning climate:We are trying to change weather but, for beginners, weather = climate??!!!Wrong! Weather has nothing to do with climate!!!!!!!!!! And fortunately, we are not able to change climate yet.
Muscle Tribe of Excellence	I'm fucking sick of hearing about this global government bullshit. Who in the fuck do you know that supports a one government planet? Do you understand how much money the rich countries with all the fucking power and money would lose? It's the most fucking absurd talking point when it comes to global warming. And countries like China, India, Iran, and every other country are just going to bow down to the fucking west!?! How fucking stupid do you have to be to think this is possible?
Mike Mentor	Adapt 2030 is constantly putting out information saying that the earth is cooling, that the sun is entering a solar minimum. Who is right?
Jim Walker	2˚C does not account for increased warmth from REDUCTION of emissions via particulate reflections of sunlight which offers limited protects by global dimming, and methane release from thawing permafrost. 4-5˚C is far more likely within the next 10-20 years. Human extinction then becomes a possibility due to loss of habitat. Methane emission alone would be five times greater than all human emissions combined. So really, it already is game over.
Wedge Wizard	We can argue all day about politics.  Meanwhile, we aren't ready to do anything about climate change because money.

Alexandre Lollini	Money don't work and is based on a faith or trust system. The dollar is the worst joke ever. Agriculture don't work and is just good at creating deserts (a field is a desert). In a forest full of fruits and vegs year round all the water is recycled insect reproduce and birds are happy, people and animals fertilise the soil. Then there is not much energy needed. Sadly there is no time to grow healthy soil food forests in all those wasted spaces in cities and on the side of roads. For the moment concrete turn rain into floods. industries are our slaves : they produce what we buy. Govts are our servants because we pay them. We can kill currencies by stopping credits. World finance will soon fall, it just need for italy to quit euro, or a french bank to go bust because of Turks stopping payments. After Euro, the US Dollar falls, money is less than air, just numbers meaning nothing. The more rich you think you are the more nothingness you have. Truth in in the soil that give food. Value is in the water, the living, we are part of.

HardWarUK	They say meat is bad, but vegetarians eat fruit and vegetables imported from 1,000's of miles away and brought in by ship or plane - so even vegetarian's are having an impact.
Duncan Mckeowm	We can forget the 1.5c degrees limit...an increase to (at least) around 2 degrees is already "baked in" due to about a 30-40 year delay in carbon dioxide effects reaching their maximum. So those fumes that came out of your car around 1980 are just now staging their star performance! I hate the idea of climate engineering, but clearing the CO2 out of the atmosphere seems the only way to go, in spite of the law of unintended consequences!
Don Gawgon aka Indigo Ives	The problem is nuclear and fossil fuels not farming. More specifically the Biggest Problem is Fuk uuu shima and "The Pacific Blob" then "The Longest El Nino in History"
Philip nik	Nobody talking about how car engines release heat into atmosphere. 1 car does not do damage, 1 billion it’s a different story. And we have more than that going on each day. If you need proof, go touch with bare hands a car engine after few miles ride.

Brentonius Aussiebloke	here in oz bamboo is a terrible idea, it out competes all natives.  never introduce foreign competition to an ecosystem, the consequences usually outweigh any benefit (especially in australia). Please only plant local indigenous flora, and never ever introduce fauna ever. Obviously this cannot apply to crops but it should be considered.

Scbrew All American	The sun Is 99.8% of the mass in our galaxy and emits the four most powerful forces known in the universe. CO2 is at 411 parts per million and plants die at 150 parts per million. So naturally, CO2 is going to end the world. The IPCC is a UN puppet to enact Agenda 21 to gain socialist control of population. Why did the IPCC falsify data sets for warming to hid the mid evil warming and the mini ice age? Why are they not telling the world that we are entering solar cycle 25 of a solar minimum? Why is the arctic ice within the multidecadal average of ice and is growing? Why has the earths magnetic field declined by 25% over the past 15 years? With a solar minimum, more cosmic radiation hits the earth and causes increased cloud nucleation. What effect does that have on climate? Why did Dr. John Casey quit the IPCC? Do you own research and stop listen to politically motivated propaganda. Start thinking for yourself and read the science, not the politics.

I would have a tough time doing that to my mother, wife, brother, sister, or anyone else.
Lars3D	Meanwhile, media and politicians are trying to distract us with dumb, meaningless tweets. Jimmy delivers heartbreaking and uncomfortable news but it's way more honest and relevant to us as society today, which is why I tune in.
fullgrunt	jimmy dore do some research on climate before spouting rubbish
IcarianX	Here in Ireland, we need to completely change our agricultural industry and diet. Currently it's mostly pasture cattle and sheep farming. Not as bad as factory farming, but the cattle in particular still produce a lot of methane... Worldwide, we need a huge change in diet. Drastic decrease in meat and dairy production and consumption. We can all do something though. Car pool! We can easily halve the number of cars on the roads with organised car pooling! It's an app waiting to happen! Cut your meat and dairy intake by half, or better, go vegan! Fly less (this one is a tough one for me, love to travel). Next time you see beef or steak in a menu or in a shop, or some battery farmed meat (any meat that doesn't say free range), just say no. Or again, just go vegan!
jamesoneful	wealthy west.........??????  stupid comment
Will Moffett	It seems like there is a new class of climate deniers out there- leftists who don't realize or acknowledge the destruction of our habitat is a foregone conclusion. We had a window, once we realized what we were doing, to correct it. That moment has passed. It's time to start thinking of ways to adapt to climate change than rather stop it. Fossil fuels are essential to maintaining a military. Getting off fossil fuels therefore is like voluntarily putting your gun back in your holster in the middle of a Mexican standoff.
sk0sH	Hmm....  I think we're fucked. After that line about needing to rebuild the entire world's energy infrastructure...yeah... that's not going to happen.   We have 12 years to do that...
ravagetime	The UN is just begging to be relevant.
Cherrie Getison	I will just say for the individual, cutting out beef is a really good thing. Cow methane (burping and farting) contributes to global warming more than transportation, and cattle ranching is the biggest reason for deforestation in the Amazon. But we shouldn't act like each individual is equally to blame. You and I will never imagine being able to compare to the carbon footprint damage that oligarchs create.

John Brooks	This whole climate change drives many crazy. NO ONE EVER discusses that if global warming is happening it’s caused not by carbon but by the population of humans on the earth. In 1920 the population of earth was 1.9 billion and 98 years later it’s just over 7 billion. Can anyone else see the cause and effect here ?? Until we start to control this out of control population growth by mostly 3rd world countries this carbon pollution will continue. More people means more resources which means more pollution.
Robert Deskins	Humans lost respect for the world, they think they conquered it but, the world doesn't NEED us and we are ENTIRELY dependent on the Earth for a place to live, the sun to power the Earth &, the moon to be a gravity counter that prevents a Solar bulge tide from existing (no moon= super massive east to west tidal wave for whatever side faces the sun every day)  Mainstream science say Homo Sapien Sapien, modern humans have existed 200,000 years with 5000 years of history but the Earth is 4,300,000,000 (4.3 billion) years old- it has existed 21,500 times longer than Homo Sapien Sapien and MANY times catastrophic events have nearly wiped out all life on this planet, explosions so big they light the whole atmosphere on fire, world wide CONFLAGRATION...... Earth will survive us and, life will start over if it has to.

And learn to hate ourselves and each other based on the consensus pseudo science we are forced to call science. Capitalism: Anything that costs money can't be done,  and it's cheap to kill.

Hugh Jarse	Keep drinking the Koolade, FFS. No part of climate change is due to human activity. This planet has been heating up and cooling down for millions of years, long before man stood up and began to walk. The sun is the culprit; always has been. Carbon dating provides very clear evidence of this. Greenland was once Tropical, then the ice age came. The sun is a star. All stars eventually burn out. Only then will "Climate Change" really matter. Until then we all will find ways to adapt. Climate Change is the second greatest hoax of all time. Human beings can find ways of cashing in on fiction. We are very good at it, and the apathetic sheeple types will buy into anything if they think it's necessary to sustain life.

Cloud 9.1	Burning one gallon of gasoline (6.3 pounds) emits 20.35 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere. That's 5 cubic meters of CO2. The atmosphere is currently 406 ppm CO2 (4 parts in 10,000), yet even at that extremely small concentration, CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas. For the 8 thousand years leading up to industrialization the atomosphere was 260 to 280 ppm. That was already at the high end of the 800,000 year range. Prior to that, 10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, the CO2 level was about 185 ppm. The natural fluctuation is about 185 to 285. With industrialization we have spiked to over 400 ppm and rising extremely fast. So ditch the fossil fuels. Ride a damn bike. As in bicycle. Everybody wants technology to solve this. Maybe some personal responsibility regarding CO2 footprint of the individual would help. Two trillion trees over 20 years would suck the CO2 levels back down, but we would have to simultaneously reduce output dramatically too. Two trillion is 50 billion per year over those 20 years. That's 8 trees per person per year. Would that be asking too much to get this fixed? But the dirty denialist is so damned concerned about his oh so precious money.
Candy Coat	what if when we make the changes (we should have been doing all along anyways) we find it also just a cycle the earth goes through ? it would be a miracle if we have any control over mother nature , like the demons spraying our skies and cloud seeding   weather engineering they probably increase climate change the same scientist on both sides are hard to trust
Des Troya	Yeah it is w0rse turns out it is an ice age
James Hansen	Deniers are criminally ignorant.
Matthew Malpeli	The alien lizards are capital itself.
Andrei Kohler	At least in 10,000 years from now Earth will be in perfect harmony with us, as nanobots will rectify all of our mistakes (this is based on scientists perception of the possible future) ... Too bad for the rest of us till then.
Beverly Jensen	Plant hemp.
Robert Rowe	hahahahahaha...................
Eric Penrose	Nellie McKay - brilliant.
Tunder Bar	Jimmy, you're a smart man. You need to go back and do your homework on this. It's a political scam. The IPCC is a political panel out of the UN. Political activism.
onifot	The thing is the headline should read that the predictions are worse than you thought.  The models that these predictions come from have proven wrong 100% of the time.  Go back and find every or any global warming/climate change prediction with a date that has come to pass - the predictions failed.  In science that means your theory failed.  Some people require more evidence before they will even begin to become mildly skeptical - fair enough.  Make an effort to notice predictions and timelines - when the times come to pass and the prediction fails make a note.  How many failures do you need before you become skeptical?
ANDRES Catella	LUCIDITY... PRICELESS...
Oculos Prime	Now would be a good time to give the Military Industrial complex a makeover.
Thomas Hancock	Right. But the consequences are even worse: The end of the century is going to see the beginning of a mass culling of humans on the planet. Meanwhile, some troll on the Internet, possibly paid by oil producers or the coal lobby, will send you a YouTube link to some crackpot scientist who says the warming isn't due to human activity. People can't deal with the breadth of destruction coming, so they go into denial.
Danzigmann	We are about to get a big taste of the carnage we've been dishing out to the natural world for the last 250 years!  Humanity's best times are now in the rear view mirror and fading fast!   If you've got hope we can some how extract ourselves from this self inflicted stupidity  you clearly are delusional.  Make the most out of the next 20 years because that's about all that's left!
John Rapp	Industrial civilization deserves to die. They brought us genocide,  class and caste structures, the technology of war, imperialism and colonialism, and biocide. Time's up, you fucking pigs.
Uncle Brutha	Sorry.. but a plant based diet is not the key to a solution to climate change. Now.. eliminating corporate agriculture?? That’s another story..
squalloogal	I couldn’t properly understand the guest. She mumbles and doesn’t open her mouth and speaks too softly.
Tide Kiosk	Large herds of grazing animals force carbon into the ground.
Fifi Covfefe	Jimmy, the sun's energy output rises and falls periodically.  Geoengineering policymakers are INTENTIONALLY HOLDING HEAT IN WHILE 1) STERILIZING US; 2) MAKING US TOO DEMENTED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT; 3) THEY WANT TO GENOCIDE 90% OF US...WHICH THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We're all descended from only 33 individuals.  THIS RACE OF PSYCHOPATHS KEEPS ON GENOCIDING US AND YOU IGNORE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Why on EARTH DO YOU BELIEVE THE IPCC, ALREADY CAUGHT IN LIE AFTER LIE AFTER LIE.  They want to steal trillions from us and give it to poor countries.  CATCH UP, JIMMY.  www.geoengineeringwatch.org
Nicholas Hanley	This is the definition of pseudoscience...
Marcus LaForge	Congratulations on yet another superb segment Mr. Dore. You successfully communicate  your impassioned stance on this topic in a manner which resonates with myself and, I am certain, many of your viewers. Indeed I credit it and you with being a catalyst in my decision to join the effort to save our world from this dire scenario.   And though the impending doom DOES seem unavoidable I would like to encourage you to maintain a modicum of optimism. Be assured that the ability to overhaul our fossils-fuel glutted energy infrastructure worldwide IS within our current technical grasp and remains a feasible achievement even within the meager amount of time frame the article allows us.   Our primary obstacle that needs to be overcome is one few consider or are even aware of: patent suppression of technologies which disrupt the status quo -  it is because of this little known fact that I myself have waited until today to come forward with my contribution to battle the tide which threatens to engulf us and all we hold dear. Again, my sincere thanks for inspiring me to rouse myself off the fence of personal indecision.  FYI: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_Secrecy_Act
Ask About Socialism/ Ask About Inequality	Animal activism that suggests a meat diet is the same as human genocide is completely useless  Only an anthropocentric mindset  That is, a human prioritizing way of thinking   Can these challenges be realistically approached
richardmtl	6:40  hemp can do that
David Tremain	If you looked at scientists (who are largely being ignored) they are saying that a huge part of the solution to CC in addressing the IPCC report is to engage in the most reliable, safe, and proven energy we have that is being pushed aside by environmentalists. It’s a fact,  look it up in scientific journals, white papers, even law suits (you’ve likely not heard about) wind turbines, solar panels and other renewables with the exception of hydro will never put a dent in the energy problem of fossil fuel replacement. The only meaningful direction in change is to have a massive federal government program that leads to the 2nd nuclear energy era.
Michael Everson	Does Nellie still do music?
wayne bailey praise the creator	problem is ice melts at 0 degrees Celsius yes? well antartica is something like -30/-10°c i'm guessing the north pole is something similair, ice will grow at this low temperature!
peter frost	climate genocide? what a bunch of drama queens. get a 'kin job.
L00Phol3 69	The problem is geo engineering. How r people so ignorant to the planes leaving thick trails in the skies? Carbon tax is just taking more money away from the poor all while making it more costly to drive and live
Little Boots	Go Vegan!
ky malone	oh you just pissed off Trump supporters
Phil Racicot	The first thing we need to do for this world is not to have kids! It happens to be the easiest solution and the one that causes least problems. Most educated and secular populations already have low birth rates (below replacement rate of 2 children per couple). But if some parts of the world don't achieve that because of religion and lack of education, we need to help them figuring it out because otherwise we'll all end miserable and suffering. The problem with some religions is that they've convinced people to accept suffering during their lifetime to get rewarded afterwards. Believers can't find dead people who'd argue they didn't get what religion promises after life so it probably is true... With this vision of things, there's no problem if you have kids that are also miserable as they'll be saved when their life ends.   Now the question is, who benefits from the growing size of the population and why it's not something that's widely spread by media and governents all around the world? Because even in the countries that have steady or declining birth rates, governments and corporations are searching for more immigration to help growing the economy (and to help keeping the wages low).  Here in Canada, one thing we constantly hear is that there's a worker shortage. While we hear that, there's a big part of the population that's inactive, unemployed or employed at wages that don't allow them to have a good quality of life (life is expensive around here because of the amount of energy we need to use to survive).   Deforestation isn't an issue that's as serious here as elsewhere and we still have a low density of population but because of our harsh climate, we need a lot more energy just to survive.  So decreasing the population in regions of the world where people survive with a minimum of energy use to increase it here by immigration has bad consequences on the environment.    That sounds like a right wing anti-immigration talking point (and it probably is) but something has to be done seriously about that.
Leo Licht	Hitler and Stalin did the same, holocaust big-time 😵🐷🐮🐣🐟🐙... 🦍✅💪😬😬😬 no Cancer 💪
Jae Lynn	I think we are at 1.7 deg already!  We are past the tipping point.
Sam Lair	Now that the truth about how dire the situation really is being truly taken seriously, perhaps I can slow down on my blogging on this and focus more on what to do next. But first: https://samslair.blogspot.com/2018/10/amplified-greenhouse-effect-fuels.html?m=1  https://samslair.blogspot.com/2018/09/angst-being-displaced-in-social-media.html?m=1
LSG	If you look back at geologic time-frames, you would see that temperatures have been 6 to 8 degrees higher while CO2 was at about the same level as it is today. In the past, temperatures have fallen as CO2 increased and temperatures have increased as CO2 decreased.  Maybe there is some external force at work here independent of CO2? I wonder what it could be?

Doc Tyler	How many people will die as a result of fighting climate change?
Disinformation World	Global Warming is so bad now that submarines have been surfacing at North Pole since 1950’s.   WTF??? Wake up people something really weird is going on and it ain’t global warming.   Watch the beginning of Waterworld. You can find a clip on YouTube.   In the opening of the movie, the melting of the north pole “ice cap” (anyone remember one??), floods the entire earth.   There’s just one problem. The north pole ice cap has retroactively vanished. If you don’t believe me take a look at any globe you have laying around your house or google maps. The north pole ice cap has vanished. It didn’t even exist. Submarines have been surfacing at the north pole since 1950’s. Look it up.   If you want to know what is really going on our timeline has changed. Six moon landings. JFK assassination car now has six people in it. I watched the video easily 100 times with a four person four seat car. Now it is a six person car. These are things I remember with more than 100% certainty and I am not alone. It’s called the mandela effect.   It’s not just the north pole on our maps that has changed either. Take a real careful look at Australia and South America on the map. Europe is also messed up too but you won’t notice if you come from these places as the timeline changes will update your memory to the current timeline.   Before you dismiss this as nonsense take a look into the topic and the rabbit hole only gets deeper: thinker statue and the statue of liberty which was now bombed during WW1: black tom german spy attack.   Remember Tinkerbell in the Disney intro? Check your old DVD’s and watch the intro again or search it up on YouTube. She’s gone.

Yuri muckraker	indeed to quote the great late George Carlin "We are shit out of luck and jolly well fucked!". Back when I used to watch Democracy Now before it came Theocracy Now since they support Islamist front groups calling themselves 'moderate rebels' and the White Helmets, Amy Goodman went to the COP 21 in Paris and spoke with radical environmentalist who said we are waay past the tipping point and scientests are even self-censoring their findings in futile hope that modest environmental policies can be pushed there. We need not just the Green New Deal, Leap Manfiesto but more importantly which is why I'm glad Jimmy and Nellie talked about the way we consume our food mainly meat we need a sustainable diet policy and consume our good in an eco friendly way which sadly even Green groups have been coopted by Democrats, Liberal, Labour Parties, the NDP and the CLinton, soros, Lannon, and Omydiars of the world who are the same side of the evil coin to the Kochs of the world.
Jim Hemphill	Hey, why don't you have some scientists on, I thought I heard 96% of the scientist say we had a window of about 13yrs. I quess  we're fucked without being kissed.
Joe Paul	3 degrees is likely. The United States will not take serious action...The projected huge increase in africa...south America and south asia population growth all that are located in the remaining rain forests is alarming. At the current rate rain forests will be all but gone in asia....half or more in Africa or south America. Scary shit
MrRainjunky	Coming to you in the next decade: the end of civilization, brought to you by billionaires and their world.
Thee Kim	We  already are in a feedback loop. Also, it will  take thousands of years for species to adapt.
Brett Sears	Wow you people are gullible.  The reason this report came out is because their previous report said that we would all die by 2020.  Well 2020 is almost here and the only thing that has changed is that the climate is cooling. (3 inches of snow in the Midwest in October!).  If the world is getting warmer you will not get colder events.  Last year there were hundreds of all time historic low temperatures.  Tell me how you get so many all time historic low temperatures if the world is getting hotter?  This is just basic reasoning.  The UN is just putting the next set of doomsday predictions out 20 years (again).  They keep moving the total destruction of the earth when it starts to get near and nothing has really changed.  There is so much wrong with Global Warming (renamed climate change because the governments knows it is a lie).  The weather and temperatures are cyclical.  They are not a straight line.  It has to do with how the earth revolves on its axis and how it rotates around the Sun.  The earths axis rotation changes as does its rotation around the sun.    CO2 is a beneficial gas.  If you remove all CO2 the earth will die.  Plants and trees use CO2 to grow.  So the only thing that has happened with the higher CO2 is that the planet has gotten greener.  Just do a little research and see areas on the globe that are now green.  Greenhouse owners have known this for 50+ years.  They put 30,000 ppm into the greenhouse so that plants will grow 36% faster.  Add in that the super Rich (banks and insurance companies) are still making 20 year loans and long term insurance policies in areas that are predicted to be underwater in 2 years (from the first report).  There has been no significant rise in Ocean levels even though the UN said it would rise 10 to 100 feet by 2020.  Do you think the super rich would give you a 20 year loan in an area that they thought there was even a small chance it would be under water?  They dont sell flood insurance if you live in a flood zone, yet they sell it in areas predicted to be underwater do to global warming.  Just maybe they know something you don't, like Global Warming is a hoax to make them billions of dollars from the panicked sheep?  Jimmy keeps saying how corrupt governments are, yet thinks they are telling the truth about this and not just scaring the sheep so they can make billions of dollars.  Why are they wrong about everything except this one thing?  LOL.  Anyone who believes global warming should be ashamed.  50 years ago the government said we were going to be in a new Ice Age and millions would die.  Now they are saying we are in an inferno and millions will die.  Why would you buy the same story over and over?  Invest in cold weather gear, the earth is currently in a global cooling cycle.  Some reputable scientist (not paid by government grants) are predicting this cooling cycle could last for 150 years. Expect to see more snow and more historic low temperatures around the world.

Jimbo Baggans	We need more time to correct these problems.   These problems are getting larger with every passing day.  How do we change,,,,,,,,,everything?  I feel confident that humanity can change, but can we do it in time?  It takes a world wide effort.  Literally everyone needs to change their ways of doing things.  Even if that would happen right now, I'm not sure if it will turn things around.   Is it too late?  The Georgia Guide Stones may just be right.

What are you doing?
Joe Bernard	old new
ex0duzz	Here's some good news to counter this.  The blond in this video talks about reforestation.. But what about China's great green wall? It's a project China started in 1978 which aimed to lessen and to stop creeping desertification in the gobi desert. Since 1978, China has planted over 66 BILLION TREES, and currently China plants more trees than the rest of the world COMBINED. It's planned fi be completed by 2050, and it will be 4,500 km long(2,800 miles).  While USA is building great walls to keep refugees out, China is building great green walls to save their country and the world. What's good for China is incidentally also good for the world.  With climate change, the dust storms are just going to get continually worse as time passes.  Every year China loses 3,600 km2(1,400 sq mi) of grassland to the gobi desert, losing as much as 2,000 km2(800 sq mi) of topsoil to dust storms.  I have confidence that a country and government such as China's will be able to meet the challenges of climate change, but if the rest of the world cannot do what China does, then China can only delay the inevitable..  China can pollute now to catch up after industrialisation, but it can also do massive green projects and just change their social policies and laws concerning environment at the drop of a hat due to them being authoritarian and centralised and united.  But what about USA? One president joins Paris accord and the next rips it up. One president supports EPA and the next appoints EPA chief as someone who wants to end the EPA.  This not only has the negative effect of wasting time and money that we can't afford to waste, but it erodes global confidence in USA and global frameworks to tackle global warming and climate change. When USA president says things like he's gonna bring back coal and coal jobs etc, that's being pathetically short sighted and indifferent. I don't think democracies allow for long term plans like China's great green wall project, which started in 1978 and will finish in 2050. Same as their belt and road initiative. It's setting up the framework for long term global dominance. USA cannot compete vs China in those aspects, but the real sad thing is that USA does not even try to compete! The world would benefit immensely if USA got into a "green tech war" with China. See who can plant the most trees, see who can go off fossil fuels and into renewables and nuclear the fastest!  China is already doing all those things and is the world leader in green tech. USA is sticking to fossil fuels and waging endless wars to continue to exploit oil for money and power even at the cost of the world through pollution and global warming. Just goes to show everyone how selfish, indifferent, and dare I say EVIL the USA is.
serg10st	thank you 🙏
technatezin	The assumption here is that human beings are intelligent animals. They aren't. There are individual intelligent people within the human species, but most people are anti-intelliectual dunces who wallow in their own ignorance and stupidity and even celebrate it. If you're going to objectively and honestly judge the human species as a whole, the only conclusion you can come to is that they're complete utter failures intellectually and morally and their inevitable extinction is only a matter of time. Whether it's by climate change, environment destroying pollution, wars of depleted resources or civilization collapse from people overpopulating their societies and turning the environment which they depend on to live into a giant toxic trash dump, the end of the human species has always been a matter of when it will happen and not whether or not it will happen.
AuntiJen	Next time you hear MAGAts go off about  'DO U KNOW how many people SOCIALISM has killed WORLDWIDE?',  these figures ON 'CAPITALISMS REAL CASUALTIES' will come in hand
bbobrm	love the show but I do not buy ANYTHING the rigging IPCC Panel says. They have been caught fudging the models used in their presentations just like the liar ,  Al Gore.This is big time fear mongering and just like Chris Hedges ( who I like for most of his wonderful work in journalism ) who is caught up in this , what I believe to be a super hype job. Think about how much carbon pollution there is from forest fires world wide. In Alaska in 2015 there was almost 2 million acres on fire alone....in one state. How many million hectares are burned in the Amazon Rainforest ? Cars, farming equipment , industry , airplanes , factories can't even come close to the amount of carbon emissions that happen by an  " Act of God ". In the middle ages it was much warmer than it is now......not much industry , factories , planes , cars back then . I am extremely sceptical of the AGW take. I would not be surprised one bit that this Global warming scare is being used as classic control methodology for us to be herded along to the beat of the Elite and is being used as mis-direction of the criminal acts and war-mongering being perpetrated on the 99%.

Robert Tony	The problem with climate change forecast is they represent averages and do not take into account weather extremes, so dangerous outliers come closer to norm and climate shifts to statistically accomadate them. How bad can weather extremes be, and out of control heating event in northern climes, releasing methane, generating more heat and releasing more methane et al and this resulting in rapid short term northern climes heating event, releasing say a metre of sea level rise in one weather event. You can not forecast for this, it will just happen, when it happens, you can only calculate the probability outcomes and take steps to mitigate the harm. It will probably happen, this is a huge amount of methane frozen in northern climes and frozen there for hundreds of thousands years, that first metre of sea level rise, will likely be far sooner than most realise.

Mark Wilcons	What people need to understand is the idea of momentum. Once something as global as the Earth's weather system is jacked into higher gears by way of heating the Arctic, Pacific, Atlantic and other oceans, it's gained momentum that is exponentially rising. To try and stop that momentum now would take an industrialized transition to renewables and carbon sequestration on a scale that would require the entire world to contribute to in a united full on concentrated determined effort. But with major countries like the US reneging on the Paris Accord, it's not going to happen. We are no longer at the point in which we can indulge in bantering back and forth on the topic. We need consensus and action, not more nukes and hatred.

MardukGKoB	It would be simple, cheap, and quick to stop the warming.  But several hundred million dollars is more money than exists in the entire world for anything that isn't war.  People need to shut up about climate change and disaster and start yelling for a War on Warming.
Harley Canine	"We'll start having feedback loops."   LOL.   You said that at 4 degrees C warming, we''ll START having feedback loops.    Obviously you're not actually paying attention.   There's already over SIXTY feedback loops that are CURRENTLY happening.   When you use the ORIGINAL scientifically accepted starting point for pre-industrial, which is 1750, you'll find out that we're already at 1.6 to 1.8 degrees C warmer than pre-industrial.   They moved the goalpost on you to make it look better for them.   Also, 2 C warming was not the original degree of warming to be avoided in order to avert catastrophe.   It was ONE degree.  It was a friggin economist that decided it was 2c.  Not the scientists.   You are absolutely correct on one thing.   NOTHING is going to be done.  Nothing HAS been done, and nothing WILL be done.  We are absolutely not going to rewire the entire fabric of global industrial civilization in 30 years, let alone 12, which is how long the latest UN report says we have to fix things.    Never mind the fact that the very same organization said we had 10 years to fix it, 30 years ago.  People laugh at that fact, and say, "SEE...nothing has happened.....we're still here!!!"    Yeah.....LMAO.....for one.....that's not how it works, and two......PLENTY has happened, as IS happening, every day, around the world.   Just for starters, look up how many heat records were broken this year.   Look up how long it's been since we've had a colder than normal month.   I dare ya.  Look it up.   Wake up friend.....you're kind of on the right track, but, you're still asleep.    Welcome to the awakening however.....at least the beginning of it...
Lee Ann	Check out a TED talk by Allan Savory--"How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change".  I believe there is also a documentary with him, too.  It was very interesting and very surprising in his findings.  A different outlook on animals--specifically herding animals--and how they can HELP green the deserts.
Dorothy Bellion	I'm sorry, there was no way North Americans and Europeans were never going to change their lifestyles enough to actually make a difference.  Nobody is going to voluntarily live like a 3rd world peasant, and no democratic government was going to force them to.
riqueinglez123	The photographer is brazilian Sebastião Salgado and the name of the movie is "The Salt of the Earth", from 2014. The technique he used is called agroforestry and is powerfull enough not only to generate forests, but to change the climate of the region and to reactivate the water cycles and the bio-system. This documentary is an absolute must see and the agroforestry movement is definitely worth spreading!
Neal DoubleAA	I usually like Jimmy's show, but this CO2 doomsday cult bullshit is getting annoying.   Go to college library, and search for history of the earth's atmosphere geology record.    You will find we are at the LOWEST CO2 levels in history, we have been 3x times higher during ice ages and 7x times higher during Jurassic times and C02 was 20x times higher than now at the formation of life on this planet.   The C02 doomsday is a scam.   Read, a geological study of the history of the earth's atmosphere recorded in the rocks in any college library and stop reading bullshit on the INTERNET and  listen to white guys with slicked back hair.
Marvin P Bungwaller	Each car or truck produces 4.5 tons of CO2, per YEAR! OVER 2 BILLION vehicles worldwide.  7,000 Coal Power plants worldwide pumping billions more tons. FACTORY FARMS known as feed lot beef, dairy, pork, create the preponderance of C02 in the AGRICULTURE sector.  SO buy grass fed beef, lamb, range pork and chicken. SO buy an electric scooter, auto,or bicycle. Learn to grow something, anything. Vote for progressive politicians. GET pissed off !
DOTCurrency	Complete LIES. CO2 is undoubtably a greenhouse gas but its contribution has diminishing returns. Above 400 PPM the additional CO2 does very little. The entirety of climate science is built on faulty feed back loops that simply do not exist. The earth is a complex system capable of incredible self-regulation. The only real threat increasing CO2 presents is to aquatic life who will struggle under a more acidic ocean.

We need to change what is meant by profit when addressing geopolitical decision making. Capitalism ignores far too many variables when calculating "profit"- it is a system built on FINANCIAL profit, only. At the end of the day, when we cannot collectively spend our way to health, wellness, comfort - hell, survival - all the financial profit in the world won't amount to anything.
Gozza Goss	Okeey Jimmy, I trusted Al Gore sold my 10 million dollar property on Sydney beachfront,  only to find out Al Gore went and bought beachfront property with his profits, then decided to fly all over the world to advise us not to buy a car, use a/c turn lights off, have no get rid of my refridgerator. Now clearly Al Gores carbon footprint is like a small suburb, for one person. Do you think he believed his BS. So why are you believing the scientists paid by Governments so they can impose carbon taxes, a full-on scam on the public. Now that western countries have decided that third world countries are not allowed to grow using same technologies US and other countries have. Sounds like an attack to stop others progressing. We are allowed to have air conditioners, but no you, certainly not poor people. I am allowed to have 6 cars, but you must have a bicycle for transport. I suggest to you based on US Californian Scientist, that believe the world revolves around California, sorry many around the world are not suffering from the same man made weather events that are taking place in so many places. Weather modification is a well documented reality. So I am glad that your concerned for US situations, if not the world is finished stop worrying about it and we will all be dead in 10 years. So sit back and relax. Nothing anyone in the USA can do about it. Global warming where, it is not a global situation, there are pockets, I will give you that. I am sure that hasn't happened any other time in the planets history Whoops, the 30 year old Climate scientists really know what is going on. For F'ks sake it is getting more and more stupid the climate science. Look seriously at the subject, look at what science peer group your are citing, check out their history their funding, what their history has been. Have they been a one issue scientist, giving reports to the same groups of headwankers trying on one side of politics trying to devise new or unique ways to fleece the plebs of money. Then you will see what is really going on, and who is behind it. The Great Barrier Reef is flourishing compared to 30 years ago, it should be dead as my brain, based on climate scientist, marine biologists etc that are not tied to funding government grants to follow certain Government policy directions, you will see some more reliable figures. Imagine living in California today, people hiding behind illicit drugs are not addictive. Then you get the who cares group, drugs don't effect me, although I was stoned when I went to my parents funeral, or my friend funeral, because I needed to be mellow. Gee you really were in that moment, you must have really cared not to be bothered about actually feeling the grief or the emotion. I can't handle the stress that is why I take it,  hang on, others have to handle the stress without it, what does it make you. I am sick of the apologist for mind altering substances. I guess we were born that way, stoned and that is how we should stay. Or maybe someone said something hurtful as school, it really affected me. For f'ks sake the sooner that generation f'ks off the better the world will be. The number of kids growing up in families with sibling from other folks, no mothers, no fathers it is a f'n joke. Communities are devastated by the lack of cohesive families, the lack of respect for folks that have a 2 parent family, it is like you are weird. Terrible if wife or mother wants to stay home and care for the kids, she is made to feel like something wrong with her, f that, get the bludgers off the arse, stop scamming others, stop scamming off parents, get a job, work hard and support your family, stop f'king whinging about it. 40 -50 year old men still whinging about their childhood is sickening, get a job, improve yourself, be decent and if you didn't smoke your money away, you would have housing and food for your family. Anyway I have had another f'king rant. This will bring the bong brains out and tell me how their life is so much better, helps with pain, help with dealing with folks, maybe the stress you feel is the physical symptom of the need for your drug.  Funny how those not using don't seem to have the fluctuations in anger and temperament. Just saying, of course that could be all wrong, and those families destroyed due to illicit drug taking  is just a small percentage. Those users steeling from parents and others, selling parents furniture for money for drugs, they don't care who they hurt, as long as they get what they want. Then of course they tell you how they care about everyone else, and are not self-absorbed. They are ll self-absorbed f'wits. There is know-one  out there that is better as a human stoned than not. Oh well there I go again. This must be cathartic for me to do every now and then.
Q Lee Miles	Words,figures,fraud and frogshit!!!   I can blow lies from my arse too...
Jim Ferguson	I would yell "FIRE!' but our theater has no exit.  The positive feedback loops have started.  It is to late to do anything.  The Exxon scientist saw this during the 1980's.  If I was the CEO of Exxon at that time I would have done just what he did.  The best we can do is to maintain social stability as long as possible.  The forces of nature are in place and beyond our control.  Just three too hot and or too wet or too dry springs and food for billions of people disappears.  We humans have enjoyed @ 10,000 years of stable weather.  That window for agriculture is closing.  Soon, world food production will fail.  When do we plant our corps?  Any culture is three days of hunger from disintegration.    There is no place to migrate to.  Where are you going to go?  Scientist are not politicians, theologians, philosophers, or poets.  Their knowledge of or use of rhetoric to warn of our situation is at best poor.   It is now clear that homo-hubris-sapiens are about to disappear.   Our society is just another about to disappear.  Nothing new here, this is quite natural.  We humans are just part of a natural cycle.  Any scientist can tell you this. But no politician will or can tell you the truth. Dictator or democrat; no politician can, will, or should tell us these obvious facts regarding our habitat.    The human response to climate change seems like the human response on Easter Island as they were cutting down their last tree.    They thought their god's were more important than their trees.  Then they learned that their god's could not create trees.     We think that profit and finical growth are more important than the environment.  To the economist the  environment is extraneous to our economy.  We are about to learn that profit and finical growth can not create living organisms.      The god's of profit and finical growth have made us blind to the absurdity of cutting down the last trees on our island.     I have passed through a morning period.  I am embracing my death.  I try to love all I see.  In my view it is too late to "do" anything.  Our day has passed.     Just for the record, I have spent most of the last 25 years wandering about in the wildernesses of the Colorado Rocky's, the highlands of Northern California, Maui, and my beloved Central California Coast.  I could do this because to get food all I had to do was go to town.      When there is plenty of wild life, living off the land is very difficult.  My hat is off to our ancestors.  We are looking at the collapse of habitat for all manuals as well as fish, birds, and vegetation.  There will be no "living off the land."     I have been hungry in the wilderness.  Lethargy and weakness take over.  Every action takes great effort.  It appears to me to be a hard death.  But perhaps no more difficult a death than those who have gone before us.  It is as if the spector of death has appeared at our party.  Everyone at the party sees it.  No one admits it at first.  A few whispers, that's about it.  A rumor of the spector begins to spread.  A rumor that everyone at the party can see and does see.  It is clear that the spector of death has not come for a particular person but this time has come for everyone at the party; including our pets.   As the last grocery store closes I plan to be wandering up a unnamed stream.  Into the unknown I go as we all must.   Good Luck to You.  ALL THE BEST
Dave McLaughlin	What a load of crap. This is all political. Co2 is what plants breath. The scientists at the IPCC can’t say anything to the contrary or they will be shunned.
Zangief The Red	Either we destroy capitalism or it'll destroy us all.
Timothy Meysenburg	Revolution is literally the only answer
D Nickaroo	Possibly Michael Ruppert is most famous for disclosing that the CIA was a major importer of Cocaine into the US -- this forced the Director of the CIA to resign in 1996. Among other things he investigated Climate Change and the Collapse that would be associated with it. Here, in 2013, he states that the $US will have to collapse before there would be even the possibility of the Real Changes necessary to address Climate Change. He says the real Govt of the US is Wall Street, not Washington -- that the iron hold that money has needs to break (7 mins): https://youtu.be/EvRJN2rblp4
Abigail Brickler	I’m trying really, really hard to make peace with the fact that I’m probably not going to get to live as long as I want to because of climate change, but I’m not doing a very good job of it. I’m terrified. I’m not afraid to die, but I AM afraid to suffer.
Scott Whelan	I'm glad you brought up the ag gag laws. It's a true indication that america is losing its way
Larry Sherk	Earth is in grave danger, from damage to forests, fields, rivers, lakes, and the oceans, and we are in the Sixth Mass Species Extinction..  It became definite and public by 2009 and 2010 that we have no valid ways of measuring the earth's temperature and no comprehension of a variety of climate cycles, many with periods far greater than a human lifetime.  But the charade was kept up, evidently for profit, and to cover their embarrassment NOAA and others renamed "global warming" as "climate change".  Which means nothing out of the normal for eon upon eon.  So our trees are short of CO₂, our industrial dumping and carelessness are continuing to damage the ecosystem, while the geomagnetic sphere comes apart with the imminent pole flip and the sun goes into the once in 400 years Eddy Grand Solar MInimum, which made things plenty tough around 1620 and 1220, also.  The data we are being fed by the MSM are either wrong or unstatistical cherry picking.  We should be hedging against drastic crop reductions while we get busy ending fossil fuels and military escapades.  In 2010 I never could have believed how many times I would feel compelled to write this.  Fascism can't stand the truth about much of anything.
Nick	It's nature trying to rid it self of too many ass holes on this planet.   It's inevitable.  Also, #MURIKA
Rick Bishop	We got 12 years to change.
Nina Banks	One small thing everyone can do easily is to use the search engine Ecosia at https://www.ecosia.org/ instead of Google. For every 45 searches, they plant a tree in a region of the world where it is needed. They have already planted over 40 million. Their plan is to get to 1 trillion but I think it can go way further. If everyone who watches this video starts using it AND passes on the information to everyone they know, that will already do quite a bit of good in dealing with CO2 emissions.
OG Johnson	What the fuck does dairy have to do with climate change? You had me till she said that?
Synerrox	Carbon tax. People won't change if they aren't forced. But there's no political will to be found for anything progressive these days in America
John Dillinger	Great episode, Jimmy we appreciate your voice
Adam Does	The real danger here is religion. Why change when this is all God's will anyway? How can we do any wrong when we are gods chosen people...
Denise McCallum	I like the hair Jimmy. It looks good!
P. A. Andrews	There's no such thing as alarmist if all they're doing is telling the truth! Support GeoengineeringWatch.org all that's needed is your time help stop abrupt climate change! And see Dane Wingington, on his YouTube channel, for a weekly update from Global Alert News!

Edward Mitchell	Right now they are sweeping a lot of what's taking place at Fukushima under the Climate Change rug. Right now the entire Pacific Ocean is sick and nearly dead as so many fish populations have crashed and it's not due to global warming but radiation which attacks the young. In the world of the survival of the fittest is truly harsh and if something is born with a birth defect they simply aren't going to make it. While the world is focused on Trump tweets the entire Pacific Ocean has been being poisoned on a massive scale by the Fukushima Plant. Mass die-offs of so many different animals has gone under the radar of the minds of the masses. The last time I went to the ocean in Monterrey I witnessed a mass die-off of seaweed which they blamed on a none existing storm. Jellyfish died in mass and washed up on the shores of San Francisco, sting rays wash up on the shores of Oakland, seal pups left to die as their parent abandon them when they can't find enough food, and mass sea bird deaths from South America to the Alaska. This radiation isn't staying in the ocean as it is being brought inland by the rains. Since California hasn't been getting much rain places further inland have been getting radiation dumped on them big time.  The truly alarming part is ever since the plant meltdown no one has entered into building 3 as the radiation is so high that not even remotely operated machines can operate inside of that building and to make matters even worse they say it will be at least 40 to 100 years before this thing is cleaned up. The disaster managed to kill practically all life in the Pacific Ocean in just 7 years and what do you think will happen in another 40 years of this contamination at this rate to the Pacific Ocean? Again the media keeps sweeping the effects of the Fukushima disaster under the Climate Change rug to hide it from the public. Here is a video you must see so that you will know just how bad things are right now in the Pacific Ocean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-P3qnlB10&t=29s
Charles Nelson	So, Greenland gaining ice mass (see Danish Meteorological Institute)....Antarctica gaining ice mass (see NASA)...increasing NH snow cover (see Rutgers University) and rapidly declining Global average temperatures (see UAH)....all these things are a sign of...a worsening crisis? Right. I see where you're coming from.
John Vaughn	Climate change all about money
Bethany Hunt	Cheapest, easiest thing we can do to mitigate climate change? Go VEGAN!! Then save up for some solar panels on your roof.
Neil Meliment	Oh my, this is frightening. And the UN is such a credible source of information; no corruption to be found there at all.  Surely now, it must be obvious that we require a global panel of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats whose authority supercedes all national sovereignty and the right to self- determination.  Only by trusting these upstanding and incorruptible individuals can we hope to save the planet.  We should all be happy to watch them grow richer with our taxes. Unfortunately, they will have to fly their private jets all over the world to attend crucial meetings.  We should celebrate the return of small shacks and travel by foot as our selfless contribution. It will be so great to live in the medieval feudal system. All for the good of the planet, of course.
Sumner Stuart	Wrong. Geoengineering and global take over of resources is out of control

Mr Robot	All hail the IPCC, I'm sure there's no agenda there lol.
Robert Hayes	RED ALERT  RED ALERT Science will not save us from Science. We need to save ourselves from GLOBAL WARMING. If the U.N. had a plan it would start something like this.   1. The world’s total population would  have to accept  to not bring children into this world for the next 20 years. ( there are plenty of children that need love and a home ) 2. People that would likre to end their lives should be legally and socially accepted.( euthanasia) (a persons dignified right)😀 3. All wars must stop today. ( people get to go home to live in there own places )   4.  The automobile industry must stop producing Fossil Fuel Powered social vehicles ending 2017. ( people get to still have a job in the motor industry building alternative vehicles )    5. All countries that can ,will need to produce their own products (reducing ocean travel fuel burn)( sustain a work force)     6. All global business will need to move investment to full blown Renewable  energy supply. ( they and their investors still make money )      7. All countries will need to grow billions of tons of Indian Hemp. The hemp will provide for a huge carbon store by making everything you can from it. Replacing all petrochemical products. (diversity will create contentment and PEACE and UNDERSTANDING. )        8. Socially all drug addicts will be supplied with there drug of choice at a place of convenience. At a cost that will cover the cost. ( social rest,the end of the black market  and the decline in overall drug use and deaths.)      9.  The amounts of Fossil Fuels  (burnt)  in the countries that will still need them will be calculated so as to keep the atmosphere stable as the gasses are reduced. ( the second and third world people will still have their first world comforts and thus we all become one world people accepting all cultures.) Sounds great hey.     10. Understanding that there is a lot more to UNDERSTAND and DO to save LIFE. The Scientific COMMUNITY have a colossal job in helping to do this. We need all of us to DO this, ALL OF US. And the list goes on. (Patience and faith in one another)   Imagine the UN achieving that, when they can’t even stop the ethnic cleansing that happens daily.
Adam K	Jimmy are u stupid? You know mainstream lies and you push their propaganda. WTF?
fl00fydragon	This is what we'll get if we retain capitlaism. At this point there's too many investments into unburnt  fossil fuels to stop as it would result in trillions of dollars evaporating from within the hands of the banks resulting in a socioeconomic collapse. The only viable option is the replacement of capitlaism and the monetary model it runs on.
John Doe	Oh well.  Fuck it.  Say goodbye to humanity.
Rodney Taylor	Go Vegan.
kimchionruis	We are at no risk of a Venus situation. But if the feedbacks go balls to the wall, a return of crocodile s to Greenland becomes more likely (a PETN situation).
Belinda Elisa	To the vegans who are angry with meat-eaters: open up your own vegan restaurant.  You will make a positive change in your community and you'll make money, that is, of course, if you take classes in nutrition, food management, marketing and finance to ensure the success of your business.
Jeff Greene	It’s about time Jimmy!!! Priority one topic big bouy!!!
End Of Innocence	Why believe an alarmist political document from the UN?
Rita Desnoyers	James Corbett does a great video on IPCC.  It's a political document, not a scientific one.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA8n9fm5fwE
Scott Dow	I’ll have to disagree Jimmy.  I was voter shamed for voting for Nader in 2000.  It had already begun.  It just became the norm under Hillary.
Eric Mcoo	There are two acid tests for spotting corporate phonies.  1. 9/11  2. Global warming.    Global warming underpins a multi trillion dollar, Enron created, carbon trading scam supported by carbon billionaires like Tom Steyer and Jeremy Grantham.  http://www.scrapthetrade.com
debbiedogs1	Yes, we have had sociopathic money addicts running things for DECADES - and they lie, cheat, steal, imprison, detain and KILL to get another 'money fix'. Wars, fossil fuels, invasions, destruction, lying to the public - ANYTHING for more money! The necessity defense is what we must use when we come for them and IMPRISON THEM so we can take over and do what should have been done DECADES ago!
The Gooch	*AMAZING COMMENTARY* this time around Jimmy! *BRAVO MAN...BRAVO!!!*
pixelspring	I don't understand why you people are swallowing this propaganda BS from the IPCC.   It's total mind control fear porn. .... Entirely designed from the start for global social control. ...   Make the connection.. yes you are being ruled by criminals.  Criminals that also manage the BS media releases from the IPCC.   It's bollocks.
Brendan Thompson	None of the worst climate change predictions have come to pass. No increase in hurricanes, snowfall is the same, no increase in droughts, no increase in tornados. Ocean level is increasing at 8 inches per century as it was prior to the industrial era. The East Antarcitc is losing ice (though 2014 was record sea ice there) while the West is gaining. All of the worst predictions are based on extremeley sensitive and highly speculative climate models that give you any result you care to model. Ocean acidification is completely speculative since there is no system to measure global PH and even if there was what record would it be compared to? Even the arcitc sea ice data only extends back to 1980 with the launch of sattelite measuring. Is that enough of a data set? We have absolutely no way to know where this is all heading but it is unlikely to be the worst case scenario put forward by the IPCC.  For 50 years we were told that increased dietary consumption of cholesterol led to increased cholesterol in the blood. That was just settled science. Today we know this isn't true. So what happens if the IPCC and the climate models are wrong? Will we start to doubt scientists and ignore their prescient warnings on a bona fide disaster?  And if your going to get rid of carbon how? No one reading this is giving up their plane flight to Hawaii. Wind and solar are not cost competitive with natural gas and that is the single greatest obstacle. Never mind that it takes something close to 15 years for a solar cell to earn back the carbon used in its manufacturing.
Jillylove 101	Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic...smfh. Banning fossilfuels makes wars for oil obsolete and seeding of atmosphere with toxins (chemtrails) unnecessary when coupled with eating mostly plants and reforestation of devastated lands, reversing ecocide is possible. Public banking could accomplish this and more and everyone must take personal responsibility. Protect Nature and do no harm. 💦🌎💦 Utopia or MadMax, it’s up to each of us. ✌️🌈❤️
Rick Larsen	Guaranteed death by crazy regulation or chance death by global warming.  Hmmmm...
Alex Cosper	Al Gore would've beaten Bush if he campaigned in his home state, TN, but didn't .. Instead he campaigned as a centrist republicrat for people under 12 and over 65 .. He didn't become that much of an environmentalist until he made his later "Inconvenient Truth" movie that was more about himself than the environment (not much new info) .. Meanwhile he lived like an energy hog in a big mansion .. So HRC wasn't the 1st lousy QB who threw interceptions for the Dem party .. Elections aren't going to save us, but national discussions might .. Mainstream media fails to raise awareness about nutrition and the environment, but the internet makes it possible .. My point is that the masses need to quit waiting for elections and become more self-educated and active .. TV turns off the mind & opens up channels to Big Biz polluters .. The first step to saving the planet is turning the TV off .. Hollywood, run by macho pervs who work closely with the NRA as marketing partners, also needs to be boycotted since most movies don't turn a profit and are a strain on the economy (they get big govt subsidies to fail) .. They are also ponzi schemes that burn smaller investors .. Filmmaking is NOT eco-friendly (it's the opposite) .. The CIA brags on its website its long-time association with Hollywood .. People need to wake up from the hypnotic effects of corp/govt social engineering.

Donald Mosher	Back when I was a young boy I would hang with my dad who liked to listen to radio talk shows and in the fifties thru the mid sixties you would hear these knuckle draggers call up and say with passion there was nothing wrong with smoking and it didn't do anything bad to your health. I consider people today who deny climate change operating at the same level of denial and moronic idiocy.
King Nobody	It's already too late. Far, far too late. The time to do something was in the late seventies when The Limits To Growth was published.
Natalie Roy	Go vegan they say, it's the solution to everything. Good health, helping the planet and animals. Ok! Step one: research, research, research. Make sure you fully understand the nutritional requirements needed to have a balanced and healthy diet. Step Two: consult with a nutritionist who specializes in vegan and vegetarian diets to further ensure you and your family are getting all their nutritional needs met. Step three: transition over a few weeks and learn where to buy healthy whole foods not 'junk food' vegan food. Step five: Hooray you are a vegan, enjoy your new lifestyle. 9 months later, after losing copious amounts of hair and suffering from severe gastrointestinal issues and further consulting with a nutritionist to make sure you are getting what your body needs, finally admit your body cannot thrive on this diet. Despite this,  purist vegans insist without knowing a single thing about my diet will tell me "you were doing it wrong" because they refuse to acknowledge that the diet isn't a one size fits all solution. Now I advocate for harm reduction, not absolutism.  If the vegan diet works for you, so be it, but many can strive to reduce their overall intake of meat and still have a positive impact. Don't eat it at every meal or daily, reduce your portion sizes ect.. Research other ways to reduce your carbon footprint because climate change is going to take a multi prong approach and anyone who believes it will be solved by simply getting rid of the meat industry is fooling themselves or has political ideology they want to push.
ThomasNSherrod	Reforestation is needed. Green technology too. How about stop having kids? Why do we need more big families/people in the world? The world's population continues to grow. No one should have more than say, two children. It's irresponsible. Carbon foot print, etc... At this point, It's all about delaying climate change. I'm a vegetarian, but if everyone slowed down their meat consumption, could delay in theory. What's so tragic is the tipping point is on it's way. It's not stopping. Water wars are coming while top world scientists (& Al Gore) fade into the sunset. Too little too late. The earth will evolve without us. Money wins. Glad I live on a hill. Trading my bicycle in for a dinghy.
Rowell Mason	But Jimmy don’t you know  it’s a hoax? All these scientists are lying, it’s a Chinese hoax Jimmy
SHON3Nknife	Does SAI get any note worthy mentions in regards to weather control as response to said future issues with climate change?
Dan Jones	It’s all over but the crying.
Paul Carter	Evidence? Evidence? Cut the emotives! Climate catastrophe could still be a huge pseudo-science constructed scam.  The real climate scientists understand that climate models are far off target and the warming is hard to measure and easy to falsify.
Daniel Gibson	The immediate stoppage of the current economy will still cause global average temperatures to rise roughly 3 degrees Celsius. Sulfates are continuously being put into the atmosphere by the burning of coal, the chemicals an airplane emits, etc. which protect the Earth from the sun's rays. Without that protection, the sun's rays will be even more potent.
Kendra Watkins	reforestation will take to long and there is now tested co2 withdraw actually tested in large scale and the risk factor of something going bad is so high. We are going to sail past 4 C in a decade. The arctic ice will be gone within the nest few years and methane release will wrap up quickly and this will push the global temp way past 2 C within a few years. We have no chance of survival as a species.
Johnny Jones	So, the story they are selling is that humans are the cause of a change of climate, and not the sun cycles?   And Everyone agrees with this?  This coould be the only reason for 1.5 degrees of said warming?  The fact that the sun is in a grand solar minimum cycle has nothing to do with climate or weather and its all because of c02 emissions? This isn't political but strictly scientific?    If you believe this, you are a brainwashed fool.  A volcano could emit the same amount of c02 within the same amount of time period and the IPCC's solution would be to bury the volcano with lots of dirt and everyone would pay  a certain amount of tax to pay for the dirt and tractors and dump trucks.   This is how ridiculous the current narrative of climate change is.

Joseph Nordenbrock	What are you going to do with your giant indoor farms without all the earthworms and natural insects ? Reinvent an indoor planet while stronger slow hurricanes, wildfires and dust storms come knocking on your greenhouse doors ? How fast can you filter pumped up ground water mixed with just a little poisoned fracking water to feed your indoor farms ? We still have no clue (including most renowned climatologists) how fast this giant house of cards will blow down in the next THIRTY freaking years with the first arctic blue ocean event ( NO ARCTIC WHITE FLOATING ICE ) practically on our doorstep in FIVE years or less. Large ocean waves will then be pounding Greenland and melting permafrost from shallow sea shelves off the coast of northern Russia. The methane monster will be like a fire breathing dragon woke up. Educated  people will still be SHOCKED !! Peter Wathams already knows all this and so does Paul Beckwith. Of course you've never heard of them from watching TV. The smell of death will be everywhere. We simply don't have the time to move to the ice caps of Mars or an icy moon of Jupiter. Create some nice memories for your kids and go camping by way of bicycle trailers and don't take along noisemakers.
Louis Gedo	Facts and logic destroy climate change deniar nonsense every time
Craig Bartel	Well when corrput , inept , and business ripp offs running things ..of course poor decisions get made . There are so many conflicts of interest I'm surprised they do anything right ! Global warming is just one aspect , chemically altering the biosphere of the planet ..aka pollution .  There are so , so many things that could be done . Part if it is that they're lazy , in denial , and stupid.  Imagine that , parasites who get rich off of exploiting other people's work , are lazy and have conflicts of interest ?!? Reforestation is cheap and would do the world alot of good . The coats need to be cleaned up because it's going to keep flooding and pollute the water , need to clean up the trash and toxic wastes in the oceans , how about repurposing some aircraft carriers to clean up the trash . Nuclear shit needs shut down , ect, ect.  So many things could be done .
Pryme54	And here I thought that all of those Captain Planet cartoons were gonna save us...
grumpygeologist	And who is going to be making the millions and billions from protecting the world from NATURAL global warming.  Warming has taken place from 16000 years ago when a mile of ice was over North America and the oceans were about 400-500 feet below current levels.  Geology doesn't lie - greedy people do.
Sandy	Bottom line is Americans need to vote!  Staying home is capitulation to capitalim.  Yes it is a crooked system with voter fraud but millions of people standing in lines that go for miles will become international news and scare the crap out of the elite.   As Chris Hedges said, FEAR is the only way to get politicians to change.   Even Ralph Nader said as bad as dems are, we have to get rid of Republicans.   Vote progressives in & corporate dems out.  Mid terms are more important than the presidential election.   People have to act.   People harrassing Pelosi & McTurtle in public restaurants has been criticized but I am  all for it!  Let these crooks & con artists be forced to hide. Show up at the polls, it matters.  Bring a fold up chair, water, snacks, signs, flyers, take pictures & post anyone denied the right to vote.
Kevin Maloney	I’m sure she’s a wonderful person but please keep her off the radio lol
crazy king	Jimmy was going to do this a week ago but put it off for a week because it’s not that important.
scubadrew9292	I used to think the people volunteering to go to Mars were crazy and stupid. They might be the smartest ones.
Matt Chew	At some point, we're going to need to refreeze the polar ice caps manually. I'm thinking that the use of liquid nitrogen in polar regions and replanting large areas of trees may be the only way to avoid complete disaster...smh
Lover of the Knowins	Animals we eat are part of the solution. Animals are just being razed wrong. Regenerative agriculture sequesters carbon.
Cb Rich	Global Warming is a bs scam by central planners and the UN and brought to you by globalists. Do some research. Solar panels and electric cars just another croney capital scam. there has always been climate change. I used to be in the astronomy business and understand physics.  The temp of the sun varies year to year and century to century. Temps actually dropping from 1940 to 1985. You can't base climate changes on such short samples. People like Soros invested heavily in "green" technology and cashed in. Then they buy up coal& oil assets when the prices drop. They play both ends to the middle.
No Way	Jimmy is pretty spot on here on climate, but I would point out we had a chance in 2000 to do something about climate also and Ralph Nader took Republican money to stay in the race.
MrBlarg74	Vote for extinction of all life 2030
Dave Carl	And the polls are in world wide, no one cares.....
steven zuniga	Plant more cows
Dale Bergeron	I didnt hear a thing the orange lady said. get closer to the mic or SPEAK  LOUDER
David Piehl	Fear mongering to promote expensive alternative energy rhetoric.  We KNOW climate change is real, we also KNOW it's not human driven. Proof? You're not living in an iceberg with half the planet frozen.  In other news, co2 may reach levels seen 3 million years ago. Where the fuck were mass cattle farms, deforestation and burning fossil fuels then? Did the world end?  Simple truth of the matter is, this planet will shake our invasive and destructive kind off with or without our help.
steve french	No climate change is way worse than YOU thought Jimmy. YOU and your conservative hack buddies.
SURFER X BLOOD	The problem of this article is the timeline. The truth is...it's already here. The elite always play with the timeline. It's already too late. They have known about the timeline starting as early as 2020 of a steep decline of human civilization since the 70's when The Club of Rome chartered MIT to do the first computer modeling of when we as the human species would exhaust our world resources.   Wars, crop loss, extreme weather anomalies, colder earlier winters and longer winters, famine, world economic collapse, social unrest, extinction level event...coming to a neighborhood you live in. This all is happening as we speak. And you all will see this happen in front of your eyes with no resolution what so ever.   The elite all know this is coming except you.   Time to wake up. Time to get yourselves prepared mentally, physically, and especially spiritually. Get yourselves ready with The Most High Father. And prep your home for at least 3-6 months of food and water to lesser the suffering and heartache that you and your family will have to under go.  The Most High Father Bless you all.
Joan Solomon	I WISH people would read this thing. It was authored by politicians, for your money,  surprise, surprise. There are whole banks of Scientists, who don't want your money, and don't agree.
Martin Decamerone	we know that for along time.
James Salvatore	Please...go vegan. Dont do it for the animals if you dont care. Do it for your health and that you can enjoy summer without fucking melting. Edit: nevermind a winter that wont feel like the last ice age.
dog bounty	Maybe you should pay your heat bill so your guests don't have to wear winter jackets.
Ben Hansen	FYI  The weather office stated that the canadian prairies are 4.5 degrees cooler than previous years. In the 1930s the prairies was in a dust bowl, in 1951 the prairies were under 3 inches of water. The planet cycles. That being said there is a lot of money to be made from the speculation.
Jason Gilliam	You're drinking too much Koolaid. We cannot control the environment, that's been made obvious by the fact the more geo-engineering these f ups attempt the more FD up our weather and environment get. Sky's falling Jimmy duhrrrrrrr
Rocksmith Live	And now we have my favorite Alternative Media spouting the same lies?!? What happen guys? You’ll be in a pickle when you’re under 50 feet of snow this decade. Climate change is coming.... it’s not getting hot. It’s getting cold. It’s not people it’s the F-big SUN!!!!!
Lloyd Tackwell	Don’t drive gas powered car go vegan go solar ect
Frost Nixon	The Earth is warming but so are the other Planets in the Solar System leading scientists over a decade ago (Nova Documentary "Global Dimming") to conceive of spraying the atmosphere with Chemicals, dimming the Sun to reduce Global Warming. Yes Chem Trails are real, by design and the Media discredits anyone who mentions them. Here's the link.   http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/understanding-global-dimming.html  Antarctica Is Melting Three Times as Fast as a Decade Ago. The continent’s rate of ice loss is speeding up, which is contributing even more to rising sea levels. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/climate/antarctica-ice-melting-faster.html  Scientists discover 91 volcanoes below Antarctic ice sheet.

Ron Froehlich	The only way to solve this is for us to have super wealthy people make a bigger, more heavy handed and less accountable government.
Benn Eden	.... we're stuffed.
Dave Doe	'Climate change way worse than we thought' Okay so.. how far underwater are the Maldives? Same question for Venice? How is it the Arctic has increased in ice depth over the last 2 years? How is it that the alarmist predictions of the last 30 years haven't come true and yet its 'way worse than we thought'? See the scam for what it is - and don't forget it followed on almost immediately from the 'Global cooling' scare of the '70's.
Ambesh Pratik	The fact that this issue is so controversial really shows the level of propaganda in Western countries. Global warming is just as real as the fact that earth is round. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps infrared radiation making the earth warm enough for the living things to exist. The carbon dioxide level has increased in the atmosphere and so has the warming as a result of it. The reason scientists know that this is because of human activities is because of the increase in c12 isotope in the atmosphere which is found in plants and animals that are used to extract fossil fuels after they are dead and buried for a long time.  This is not controversial among physicist, Chemist or climatologist. Regardless of who supports what, these facts remain to be true. You only have to know basic science to know this. Those who wants to deny ought to prove a lot more than just saying temperature is not rising when it clearly is. do they mean that carbon dioxide level has not increased? do they mean the greenhouse effect is not real? Climate change deniers and flat-earthers are the laughing stock in the scientific community but I think it bodes the scientists well to educate people who have been brainwashed instead of ridiculing them.  I am a poor graduate student of physical chemistry. My country has been suffering from an abnormal amount of floods and drought in recent years. I only wish that people would come together and fight it globally. I don't like the democratic party of U.S. and I can't vote so I have nothing political to say about it. This is bigger than any political parties. Please wake up before its too late

Comrade Björnsson	I see there are a lot of pro-vegans advocating their mf diets. And I can sympathise that they are on a mystical soul voyage to attack the problem from the root cause, avoidant of any structural analysis, pure agentical ideology mmm mmm mmmmmmmm . However, they are one step away from truly sustainable practice which is FULLY AUTOMATED GAY CANNIBALISM SPACE POSADIST COMMUNISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. made by NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG NAZBOL GANG. And yes Cannibalism is clearly a more moral stance then veganism, you are not only reducing your own carbon emission footprint but your reducing others too.

Shadowcruise99	*Climate Change is what happens when countries practice weather weaponization.  They don't enact International Laws for activities that don't exist.* Geoengineering isn't new, it's been utilized in one form or another since the 40s.   The United Nations should know when the ball is going to drop, they've been right in the middle of it.  Anyone familiar with the United Nations' Agenda 21 and Agenda 30 _the Sustainable Development initiative,_ is well aware that the sole purpose of weather modification is just one of multiple black operations in existence to significantly reduce the population _(Georgia Guidestones)_ and completely control the stated 500 million surviving individuals.  That's a 90+% decrease, amounting to a population of just under 7% of the current census.  *In other words, 93 out of every 100 individuals must die to meet the goal.*   If memory serves me correctly, they've already planned the after game party!   *Weather Modification Laws:* https://climateviewer.com/2016/05/14/weather-modification-laws-in-the-united-states-of-america/ *Georgia Guidestones:* https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/georgia-guidestones
Crystal Giddens	It is a shame Dore is so right on so many other issues. I hate he has fallen for this scam. The facts are clear and this is beyond bogus science. to the point of being absurd. I have a hard time believing he believes this garbage unless he has done no research at all and chooses instead to listen to known liars. Why? It doesn't make sense.

Elijah Ben Israel	You know why people don't vote/ simple. None of them tell the truth. and the one asshole people of color expected to tell the truth Barack Obama. turned out to be the same as the others. That is when people said this shit is rigged. these people are selected. That is why people don't vote. Especially people of color. If this aint going to get no better and this is the fate. So be it. Gil Scott Heron said it best. "the revolution will not be televised". Think about it. the media is everywhere. But when the shit really happens. there will not be a single camera anywhere to see the devastation that will take place. And that time is approaching. How long do you think this present system of doing things will last. This midterm is the last hurrah. It is about to get serious. Prepare and beware. Those that think this is under control are in for a rude awakening. And that pacifier, they are sticking in everyone's mouth is not going to work. The p[people have had enough. Those that are in charge had better run. Where, I don't know. But this ballgame is in the ninth inning and there are two outs. There is no rabbit in the hat. The deal is done. No one has an answer. And money is no longer it. The game has to start all over. Those that have it all, cannot believe they can keep this up. People are mad.They are just waiting for the opportunity for this to pop off. And it is coming.
Angelo Brattoli	Human beings are omnivores. Having an animal rights activist on to talk about this issue is counterproductive. The issue isn't "don't eat meat". The issue is a restructuriing of our manufacturing infrastructure. Doesn't this woman understand that to cultivate plants ALSO requires fossil fuels at present.
Επαμεινωνδας Κοσμας	I don't get the hooplah. All this was going to happen eventually. What's the difference of its in 100 years or in 100,000? We are a finite species on a finite planet revoking around a finite star. Who cares.

DeBee Corley	IPCC?  Caught faking statistics, yet, still touted.  Here is a prediction for you:  2025, the Singularity.
Bushbuddy Platypus	How can we be do sure about manmade climate change when all we hear from media regarding mass murder FOR PROFIT is propaganda. Honestly, look at all the very many qualified skeptics who regard these changes as cyclical. what of climate-gate? This hoax was created by rich criminals, who have a stranglehold on scientific institutions. Don't buy it.  Anyway climate science is not something most people can understand, and we are thereby more prone to accept the fear mongering as fact.

R3DRUM3K	It is human nature and culture to hang on to a state of actual comfort and wealth and ignore all red flags for the near future. Its why all empires in the past have collapsed. We have an unique technological opportunities to be forwarned and transform rapidly but it requires the will to change from consumer to caretaker. Sadly I think the odds for global war on recources and habitat is a much more likely scenario. In a sense this is already going on. "Look upon my works ye mighty, and despair"

WS Intern	Yes, humans your time has come: greed, war, discrimination, hate, pollution will soon end. By the way, warming up the planet is one problem, BUT rotation and axis will change and will have far more impact. I knew this already 20 years ago that this would happen, it’s just mathematics, every year it speeds up temperature (x2). But doesn’t matter; there are endless universes, dimensions and lifeforms. We will never learn from the past and we are not rational beings.
Mario Cavolo - The Shanghai Desk	Good grief, I really like you for so many reasons, but this is just so ignorant. Jimmy why are you talking about temperatures on Venus? If our best case scenario is CATASTROPHIC, are you suggesting that it was NOT going to also be CATASTROPHIC without our involvement? Please check the history of the planet's weather in greater detail.  There have been nasty heatwaves and cold snaps over thousands of years, RIGHT? RIGHT? RIGHT?!!!!!!!!!!!  Ahh, I feel better now, please don't be part of the problem with the politicizing of global warming and the Paris Climate Treaty supporters et al .   The U.S. under Trump is NOT doing nothing. Good grief, you ARE being too much of a naysayer and then we ARE ALL GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY AND THERE IS NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT. By the way, I know you're right about all the corruption, every miserable drop of it, we are POWERLESS to do anything about it. Have a steak and more importantly, enjoy it. Cheers, Mario
John Paterson	Glad you got onto this Jimmy. Politics is no longer an option. Massive civil disobedience (see Roger Hallam radicalthinktank) is the only option. Must disagree that planting trees or stop cutting them down will solve the problem. Or treating animals humanely. Drastic mitigation of CO2 must happen now. But agree the chance of that happening is zilch.
Nova Yakisoba	I just want to hear the exact date when New York City and Washington D.C. will be under water. It turns out that the fat rich old white man who lives near Santa Barbara was wrong. I know Jimmy will correct his errors.
Pasha Pasovski	Reforestation of desert land is the best way to get a hold on CO2 and would make profit for all involved! China is already doing this and successfully!
The Last And First Time	*More* people need to talk about this report. A lot more.  Like fucking *everybody.*
Daniel Breiland	OMG that Nellie girl is so cute. I think that should be the focus here considering we're all dead anyway.
Ped Clarke	Climate models are futile. Climate is a chaotic process. CO2 is a minor greenhouse gas. Water vapor (clouds) insulate the planet from heat loss (infra red). The earth was much warmer a few thousand years ago. Climate is not consistent! Look at data dont just swallow the hype! (also CO2 is dense, it sinks to the surface below Nitrogen and Oxygen so it is not present in significant amounts in the atmosphere).
che zus	i think i have to clarify something here for people who will inevitably argue there are no SUVs on venus: just because it can happen for other reasons than human activity, doesn't mean we should do anything we can to make it happen. an analogy: you can get hit by a car without it being your fault; that doesn't mean you should dance on the freeway to the sound of passing cars.
Patricia MacLeod	Pollution is for idiots.
USS Spirit	Gandalf says... Run! you fools! (and stop eating meat) while you are at it.
Frank Parenti	Love Ya Jimmy but the U.N. IPCC is far from a scientific body.  By every measure, they are a very political body with very political objectives.  The idea that we can measure a global average temperature is itself a ridiculous idea and even more ridiculous to think that we have the ability to calculate that down to tenths of a degree.  The U.N. IPCC and UNFCCC have demonstrated over and over for more than 20 years, that they have political objectives and are more than willing to insert non peer reviewed and grey literature in place of peer reviewed work, when that benifits their political objectives.  We do need to understand what we are doing to the environment but we aren’t going to gain that understanding hrough the IPCC and UNFCCC.  They are to political now to help us understand what we are doing or to lead the global conversation about the trade offs and what it is that we can and can’t live with as a global community.  The U.N. IPCC, an unelected body, is now simply trying to exercise a global tax system which places who knows how much fortune under their control.  No oversight.  No accountability to any of us.  We should continue to focus on being good stewards, but these apocalyptic headlines aren’t helping.  I think Jimmy could provide us all a great service by holding the IPCC accountable in the same fashion that he does with the DNC and Democrats in general.  The IPCC are like corporate democrates, they’ve proved that time and time again.  We need Jimmy and those like him to help us hold these global unelected politicians acooutable.
Mathew Arellano	I love how climate change deniers will say the earth has heated up before and we've had Ice Ages. Mother fuckers, did those people thousands of years ago rely on the same kind of shit we do today? No! So you can imagine since we're not survivors like they use to be the majority of human beings are fucked.

Klaus 003P84	Hey Jimmy.. you're right with that title in my opinion.. but I fear that feedback loops that you were talking about starting at 4 degrees average warming, have started all ready.. the most terrifying one the methane emissions from natural sources (seafloor or permafrost) have started to leak in 2010. back then nasa started the project 'carve' to gather data around the conditions of methane releases.. take a look at interviews of natalia shakova.. a researcher at east sibirian arctic sea.. the ticking of the timebomb is the loudest there..  Love you jimmy keep it up.. Loved to see chris hedges on your show..
Rick Ducharme	We will do those things that you say we won't do, and we'll do it the only way it will ever be possible to do it:  We'll do it by democracy over the wishes of the corporate tyranny that rules us.  That tyranny is large and in charge presently, as we all know only too well.  They know very well that we have the potential power to change the world, and it scares them to death.  In the meantime, you know it's getting depressingly bad when you see Bernie out there cheering on corporate republican lite democrats for office and exhorting everyone to get out and vote to install these useless parasites who only do the bidding of their corporate masters.  Really Bernie?  Why is it important to keep voting in these corporate tools?  The argument can be made that the republicans are 10X worse because they are.  But, I would argue that it's better to let the republicans destroy themselves and the entire system so that it finally collapses than to forestall that inevitable collapse by electing the likes of Obama, Clinton, et al.  After the collapse people will finally wake up and hopefully the attending change of consciousness will enable us to move on in the right way so that we can live in harmony with nature by doing those things that we must do in order to survive.  Love your show, love Stef, love your guest.  You're doing a great job, and we need your voice.  Carry on.  Cheers!

Christopher Dennis	Jimmy, stop dancing around it. Go ahead and say it. Capitalism is the problem. It cannot be reformed. A new economic system must be built. THEY know this. And they are getting prepared for it behind the backs of the public.  The problems are so large and pervasive that the only institution capable of a response is the military.
ArkTiger4c	FFS climate change has been happening for millions of years naturally I'm sick of hearing this hippy shit !!!!
chisler26	We don’t have to wait for politicians to do anything, we all have the power in our own hands( or on our own plates).

It's just another scam put forth by the ruling elites to exploit and control the masses.  I know you're smart enough to figure it out if want to.  The IPCC's fraudenlent data is good starting point.  Love your show!

Brandin Shaeffer	Analysis shows that animal studies actually are incredibly unreliable because the animals used are NOT human.  But corporations LOVE this because in many cases a positive result in their testing is all they need to tout its benefits ....even all the while knowing that the same study CANNOT be replicated on people.  SAME with petri dish studies though.  What happens in a petri dish is often not replicated in human trials.  The scientists just want grant money - PERIOD.  The companies just want that FDA clearance - PERIOD.
Vegan4ThePlanet	#WalkTheTalk     DONT BE A HYPOCRITE!  Really sick to death of listening to people preach about saving the planet screaming at corporations and governments and then turn around and eat animal products.  You CAN NOT be an Environmentalist or Care about our Planet and consume dairy and meats!    Animal agriculture is one of the 2 top causes of Climate Change AND it is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction.  According the the United Nations, we can not sustain the animal agriculture with the growing population without devasting our planet. Currently Animal Agriculture covers 45% of the planet's land surface, and is expanding exponentially.         GO VEGAN and Save Our Planet
Sp0okeh	these corrupt capitalists aint gonna listen until Florida sinks; hello Venus, Earth will soon join you.
Aegon Aram	The criminals are also in control of the science. If all we know, every bomb they drop causes the most global warming. The Paris agreement is just more power and more regulation for Government.     It only takes 2 tree to be planted per person on the planet, to offset our life time emissions. Yet they are not telling people, ''We are in danger, plant trees'' Instead they are trying to pass new ways to tax you. Than they will use that tax to make more bombs.     The solution is simple for Good people. Focus on yourself, plant trees, eat less meat, eat more local food, drive less, don't over eat. They will not stop killing people and ruining the environment, they are murders at heart. But it will be the good people who have the last laugh, I promise you.
B-rizz	Jimmy, please try & get Prof Guy McPherson on. Warning, his predictions, based on the scientific evidence as he perceives the data, is a fast approaching horror show. FYI, for those that may think 2 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1750 baseline doesn't sound like much, the last ice age was 4 degrees Celsius cooler than the 1750 baseline. In other words, it means scorched fukin earth is on the way & soon

Mrdead Inmypocket	When you talk about people suffering, heatwaves and economic destruction. Who do you think will "suffer" exactly? It's won't be the top 10% of the population, they can afford to hunker down. They'll still be able to afford beef and air conditioners. If their coastal properties flood? They'll just pack up and buy some more property. It's the working class and poor that will suffer.
Ken Bush	I live in middle Tennessee late October and I am freezing     same for 48 years and counting   global warming is a giant hoax

Johan Viskar	Climate change is the crownpiece of fake news. I dont understand why you fall for it without questioning any of the fundamental premises on which all these "reports" are constructed Jimmy.  It is a narrative, scare tactics and you fall for it like a sheep. Disappointed....
Bearded Jagger	It'll never happen. Leaders in this country can't even agree on global warming. So you'll never get the world's leaders to work together to make any significant difference. Every country has its own agenda.

Frank Blackcrow	Getting rid of meat agriculture,, would that work.. as to not eat meat, we would have to keep killing all the animals to keep them in check seeing as they say methane from cows is a problem.. what happens when we stop eating meat.,, the cows are left to keep going as they would have.. or do we wipe them off the planet.. as like they did to the bison.. to stop the Indians from their agricultural practices of meat farming with free range.. don't forget if more people will be eating vegetables that means more agricultural land would need to be obtained.. or do we eat kelp and other products that some have said.. like roaches.. and other bugs.. all would still need to be mass produced or do we do what they want with how that they did in the movie 1984.. and stop people from unlawful reproduction.. and create a fake war just to keep wiping out the population as to that end of not needing to feed as many people or cloth them or to have them being the reason for global warming.. because when it all comes down to it.. the cows wont care,,, it's us that it comes down to.. what do we do.. because we know what the governments would do.. put everyone to a system that they control and tell everyone that they need to do it for their/our own good.. and that everyone will agree to it as being the only solution.. as the government knows what their doing .. for us.. because thats what they will agree to.. that they say we agree to.. because if you don't agree they will arrest you and send you off to a fake war.. just like the middle east is.. to wipe out a over bearing population of a certain part of the world.. but that they just keep breading like rabbits. Cows are not the problem.

Phil De Punter	Bullshit Jimmy.... we have started the process of global COOLING with the start of a grand solar minimum! It's nuts to say carbon dioxide is bad in the such minor amounts in our atmosphere when without it we'd have no vegetation at all, and the small increase has helped increase plant growth to help feed the planet!
Quadpod	That's what happens when momma Earth gets sick, she gets a fever to eliminate the contagion... in just so happens that humans are the contagion.
Damian Luch	no worries - we'll nuke each other well before the weather kills us off
Cranky Kitty	Wet bulb temperatures will begin to kill millions of people, especially the hot and humid countries and parts of China.  Follow Paul Beckwith and others here on YouTube.  I don't personally think "we have 12 years," and you are right -- the IPCC has been way too conservative in their reports.
John Carpenter	And yet, under the Paris Climate Accord, China will double the number of coal burning plants and India will also increase the number of them too. At the same time, the United States has no plans to increase coal burning plants at all. In addition, 500 cargo ships emit more CO2 than all the cars in the United States and can easily be made to burn cleaner for a minimal cost. That is also not included in the Paris Climate Accord. Why and why do people trust these reports? While the west has been reducing its pollution, China and India have increased theirs immensely and we shipped all our manufacturing to them. We could require countries selling goods in the west to not use coal burning plants in the same way we prohibit them using child labor; but, that would have been prohibited under the TPP.
Bill Smail	Just because they run on something does not mean they will keep their promise.
J Freedman	jimmy, why do you assume that green is not as profitable? the truth is that they worship evil, they voted for trump because he is evil, they want to enslave, eat and rape, pillage and murder  other people, this is the republicans morality.
Ella Blun	dude, no one's gonna give up meat. stop giving saudis money, and stop chopping down forests for production of palm oil and other vegan popular products, and problem is solved. anyone who thinks cows are bigger polluters than transportation industry, is a fucking moron.  in fact, chopping down of forests is biggest problem here. we just removed one of our planet's lungs for the sake of fucking vegans, and now we blame meat for it? as long as you push for false solutions, you won't solve anything.
Ju-87 Stuka	Who cares, view the earth as lungs, it will inhale and exhale. The heat is the inhale and the ice ages is the exhale, it will repair itself, humans need to stop thinking we have absolute control. We’re going to die, we’re going to be forgotten, that’s okay.
BK Bland	It's gonna be a tough century. If folks survive that one, the next couple won't be much better.I think humans will survive, but the society, the civilization is doomed.  Maybe the great filter is the solution to the Fermi Paradox after all.

Casie Jensen	the photographer nellie mckay is talking about is Sabastiao Salgado.  He's Brazilian.  He has a massive photo book called "Workers".  Everyone should read this book.
Brian Boru	"Because at 2 degrees Celsius it's catastrophic." Wrong. Check out our planet's temperature history. It's common for it to be 20 degrees Celsius hotter than now. Actually we are now in a "glacial" period, with ice at the poles. Ice at the poles of Earth is NOT normal. It happens occasionally, but is NOT the norm. So these throwaway and voluminous cries of "Catastrophe!" are anti-scientific and authoritarian (You are relying on the word of the "authorities" instead of using your Nature-given power of reason, which is what people did in the dark days before the Enlightenment.)  And you even admit to your shoddy reasoning on this when you start saying around 1:50 "My brain can't even take this! I just go 'What? What?' "  You're being duped (again).  ... Good God!

Jeffrey Coolwater	For God's sake, Jimmy, with all due respect, don't fall into the donation-driven, corporate animal charity, animal Welfarist trap: It's not about factory farms! It's about ALL animal agriculture! And eggs and dairy are part of the meat industry! I've been trying to tell you for two years now. You need to go vegan AND tell your audience to do the same and then go out and get others to go vegan! In 2009, a UN FAO report already confirmed ALL animal agriculture was the biggest ecological disaster. If we're going down, we should be going down fighting for justice for all. That means being vegan WHILE fighting the oligarchy. www.HowDoIGoVegan.com www.AbolitionistApproach.com

Lazylady	There seems to be a general lack of understanding about climate change.  The earth's climate has always changed whether there are humans or not.  There have been ice ages and other ages with tropical climates.  At one time the central US was an ocean.  At one time the Sahara was green. The climate and the earth are always changing.  Humans need to learn to adapt to the earth and its changes instead of trying to force an artificial constant changeless environment.    The government has realized the futility of going against the earth's changes when it stopped putting sand on beaches or keeping barrier islands in the Atlantic from eroding.  Barrier islands are not meant to be eternal.  Beaches disappear.    Humans may have accelerated the climate changes.  However, humans really don't understand the process of climate change since civilization is only 5000 years old according to historians.  Technology is only about two centuries old.  Humans can inadvertently cause harm by interfering in a natural process like causing super wild fires when they prevented naturally occurring small wildfires which helped to replenish the wilderness.  We need to understand the natural process more before we create unnatural means to solve  problems that we don't fully understand.
Accelerationist	Fuck your minorities. Bring on the collapse!!!
Arkone Axon	I would like to point out one thing.  In Russia, there's a statue to honor the animals used in laboratory experimentation:   https://www.buzzfeed.com/donnad/russian-scientists-build-monument-to-honor-lab-rats  I have four dogs. All four of them were vaccinated against, among other things, tetanus and rabies. Anyone familiar with story titles like "Old Yeller" or "Cujo" will understand what an amazing and important thing that is. The animals that gave their lives to help create the vaccine that now saves countless lives (human and animal alike) were heroes (as dogs generally are).  So I'm against animal testing for the sake of, say... cosmetics. But I believe it was Bill Burr who said that if hooking up a guinea pig to a car battery would lead to a cure for cancer, then all that needs to be said is that the red is positive and the black is negative.
Rafael Rafael	When I become presidenté I will appoint JiMmy to be the head of the climate change bar....I mean zar.
David Primeau	In the 1970s while in high school I was taught we were in an interglacial period in my environmental studies course and a glacial age was inevitable.  We were headed for a real cold period, crops would fail and millions would die from starvation. In the 1990s I was told that global warming was here and we would all be extinct or underwater within 10 years. In the past 10 years I have been told that climate changes and I have to pay for it.
Are Traps Gay	No it's not.
Ghost2Coast	A large amount of blame needs to be put on environmentalists that ruined our nuclear energy advancement, as ironic as that is. Nuclear is the only viable option to get us off fossil fuel, I like solar, I like wind, but both are far to unreliable to meet our civilization's 24/7 energy needs.
sailormanariel	I'm glad I'm old and will die soon. But not soon enough.
David Richardson	Hey Jimmy If you haven't went vegan yet you are willingly participating in the greatest cause of climate change and you've allowed yourself to be bought. There's another way to fight this system.. Go vegan.
Joe Rodriguez	Wow
Andrew M	You want to feed a current world population of over 7-billion people it's going to take factory farming. You want to live your current easy life here in West, (which I know I'm guilty of, and most reading this) and now growing in the East, it's gonna take fossil fuels, "slave labor" and habitat destruction. The only way to stop this is a large negative growth of the  human population. A stop of almost any type of consumerism/materialism. Even though I don't agree with the methods of getting his message out, I think ole' Ted might have made some good point in his writing "Industrial Society and Its Future."  On Earth, humans will be the "Great Filter."

TheGordo1996	Venus is a hot planet because is was formed only a few thousand years ago, not because Venusians had too many coal plants.  Early civilizations from around the world, described Venus as a comet.  Also, the entire solar system is heating up due to increased output from the Sun.  There has recently appeared auroras at the poles of both Jupiter and Saturn.  Our space probes have other evidence.  The Earth goes through 100,000 year Solar heating cycles and is in an up trend.  If you think paying carbon taxes to Al Gore or some globalist org. will help to adjust the world's climate, the you go ahead and give your donation.   Much of what passes for mainstream, settled science if fake, phoney, and false.  America has done more than its' fair share at reducing CO2 and CO pollutants.   I'm done with seeing the globalists get a free ride on America's tail.

In the 80's I used to go trick or treating in a snowsuit with walls of snow piled up on both sides of the road around me. Last year the ground didn't freeze once during the entire winter, this year we are forecast 5 days of below zero celsius (32 farenheit, aka freezing) from now until the end of january.   The further north you are the more blatantly obvious climate change is.

TX Rider	Worse than we thought? Gore said the state of Florida would be underwater by 2014.. If you want to stop the increase in CO2 you can either uproot the entire global economy banning fossil fuels, or you can listen to guys like this who have solutions that not only don't require stopping fossil fuels, but produces more food, more habitable land, and more economic growth.. Your not going to replace the entire energy infrastructure of the world, and the entire way the world is fed, in 20 years.. You can however use other solutions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI

B. Greene	One obstacle is the Evangelicals. Years ago I was helping the wife of a coworker clean up after an event. I asked her where the recycle bin was, she replied “oh, we never recycle silly! Whatever we can do to end the earth sooner is good, because then we’ll be Raptured with our children!” Naturally, I was struck speechless by this stupidity for a moment (they were huge “Left Behind” fans). I finally said “I really don’t think that a deity would respond well to blackmail” (I should have asked her to point out the Rapture passages in the Bible, because they aren’t there). I’ve told mutual friends about this exchange for years now, and they’ve heard the same from friends and family. Pence is one of these ecocidal/ suicidal nutcases as well!
Scalisi	a whole foods, plant-based diet is better for your health, the environment and of course the animals. there is no sustainable form of animal products that would scale to a global level, especially as the world continues to adopt our western diet. most animal products are unhealthy, but certainly are not necessary to be healthy. animal products commodify sentient beings for our pleasure of taste, which is unjustifiable in the modern age. switching to a plant-based diet is not difficult or expensive - just eat vegetables, fruit, beans, lentils, soy, seeds, nuts, etc. although vitamin b12 is included in many fortified foods like plant-based milks, it's literally the only supplement you'll possibly need on a proper whole foods, plant-based diet. going vegan is the least you can do and is a completely voluntary act, which makes it a non-partisan issue. if you want peace in the world, don't just wish for it, start acting by removing the unnecessary violence on your plate. there's a reason ag-gag laws were enacted to keep animal cruelty behind closed doors. people are inherently against animal cruelty, which is unnecessary harm to animals. raising animals for slaughter in 2018 is the definition of animal cruelty given it's completely unnecessary. if you can't go vegan overnight, reduce your consumption of animal products as best as possible over time, which includes products made from animals' bodies (leather, wool, etc), entertainment that uses animals (zoos, aquariums, etc), products tested on animals, etc. Cheers
Jo Hickey	there is another thing that is going to wipe us out, Fukushima, they are lying about that too, see Dana Durnford the nuclear proctologist for details

D. Russell Moros	Hey Jimmy and crew. The reactionary fossil fuel promoting stooges/trolls are out in full force, check the comments! Paul Beckwith explains how (using empirical data) the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change probably underestimates how much global temperatures have already risen.   Abrupt Climate Change Will Rapidly Blow Past 1.5C and 2C  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyZs6LdQ1cQ
Bill Doucette	Jimmy  they know a Mini Ice Age is starting.  If you do  fair research you will find out the Co2 is determined by Temperature.  CO2 IS plant food and the World has been greening like crazy and crop yields are higher now.  CO2 IS PLANT FOOD.  Co2 right now is a result of Temperatures 800yrs ago.  Don't believe me, I can show you 2 presentations made to the Senate by climate researchers. Scientists. PhD Nobel Laureate agree co2 is just being used to Raise Trillions and whole new Industry on False Science.   It's all a scam.  Trillions and many will siphon money in greed.   Look up 4 professor speak to Senate.  Co2 comes after temperature.   Top scientists are stating the Globe is now at the start of a Mini Ice Age.  Millions will die as they won't be able to afford food and heat energy.   Remember my words....
Abu Mansaray	i believe nothing that comes out of the UN
BlackLodgeCooper	Diet is changing. There are loads of militant vegans in the U.K. that shun you for not being "woke " if you still eat meat and dairy. Eco-Fascists. We are, no doubt effecting the environment but The evidence that human CO2 is the sole or even the main driver of temperature change is inconclusive at best, with a lot of evidence to the contrary. (See James Corbett  @CorbettReport for this more on this, among other places). Pointing out contrary evidence is not "climate change denial". Climate change is being used as a tool and an excuse to bring in global centralised governance. The New World Order is here and the kids are crying out for it, as those of us who have been watching this unfold for a long time always knew they would be. It's so insidious, it's sickening. They never mention the  Geoengineering and high voltage "Auroral Research" that's been going on for years in the climate conversation.
vizak20	Bs report get it together JD
EgadsNo	If anyone thinks ocean dead zones are a serious problem now, research the Mariana trench- seems like soon it will be full of PCB and several other highly toxic compounds that are highly stable in the cool heavy pressures of the ocean, but you know what people will ignore it- because their cool new high tech products being made in China are the cause.  As for the IPCC issuing a dire warning, that is a bit like saying chicken little just issued a statement that the sky is totally falling now.

Its all political aimed at the people.. Social control, total control.. agenda 21. Telling us we must eat 18.000 % more soyebeans 😂 Monsanto GM soya.. thats what its about.  Total control
Justin Hansen	Scaremongering. The Earth used to have a circumequatorial current and this kept the planet warmer than today. Once North and South America joined in Central America that current shut down and the ice caps, which did not exist at the time, started forming. It has been warmer in the past than even they are warning about. Life flourished and northern latitudes were more habitable. The real issue is sea level flooding coastal areas and local climates shifting with modern humans and their built up infrastructure lacking the mobility to take advantage of shifting conditions.

titovalasques	90% of rainforest deforestation in Brazil is due to growing soy to feed animals so we can have a burger or bacon. We’re overfishing our oceans so effectively that by 2040 our oceans will likely die. Does any of you guys know what our main sources of oxygen comes from? 2/3 of all emissions is from animal agriculture which breeds into existence and kills 70+ billion animals every year and a lot of that is from the animals themselves in the form of methane. If you can call it a silver lining the one redeeming factor in this is that methane ‘only’ has a short half-life span (10-15 years) which means we can solve this, but it needs a personal commitment from each of you. Simply choose a plant based (vegan) diet. You can still have your burgers and bacon, just choose the plant based version instead.

Gavin Sealey	Jimmy's short presentation provides a good introduction to the issue of the climate change catastrophy. as a human species and as individuals we need to change our ways. Here are some of my suggestions for political and personal action:  1. If you're in the west consume less. Don't manufacture or buy unnecessary stuff. 2. Share more. Make sure no one starves even if it means you eat less. Make sure everyone has a home even if it means your home is smaller. 3. Phase out meat and dairy farming. We all need to move to veganism. Is eating fish sustainable? I like eating fish but we have to ask the question. 4. Dont buy plastic toys, plastic bags or plastic water bottles. 5. Reduce the use of fossil fuels through sustainable green energy use and a drastic reduction in energy consumption. 6. Don't even think about fracking. Stop it now. 7. Don't be a frequent flier. You may be able to afford it but the planet cannot. Focus on making your local environment more appealing. 8. Don't deforest. Reforest. 9. Rationalise production by taking essential industries into public ownership 10. Learn to repair stuff rather than replace it. 11. Don't think going to nuclear power is going to help. Disasterous weather conditions and degraded supply infrastructures can lead to Fukashima type incidents. 12. Move globally, nationally and personally from a competition mindset to a cooperation mindset 13. Work for global disarmament and repurpose the military to disaster relief and environment protection forces. 14. Work for change in your own local communities but communicate and coordinate with other communities regionally and globally. 15. Meditate and pray. Things are going to get very rough and we're going to need acceptance, faith and love to get us through.
tod jones	Jimmy, if you don't bring on one or more of the independent scientists that contradict this whole "climate change" meme, I'm going to have to withdraw my pateron support.  You are blindly going along with the government propaganda of the goofy left.  I had to stop supporting Bernie too since he continues to use the climate as a political weapon.  I dare you to have someone not on the federal  gravy train to give a different perspective.

Do you realize that "signing and accord" Do NOT constitute a thermostat of the planet? That man has the power, technology or knowledge of controlling the weather?  Look around your study...everything requires PETROLEUM...even the IPCC people spend billions flying, consuming and enjoying worming and cozy room hotels.  The best that ever happened to the planet is CO2  By the way, soil emits 9 to 12 times more CO2 than anthropogenic emissions.  And that stupid crying woman (in a yellow-red coat is unbearable) never ever invite her again, or you lose my support!  Jimmy YOU NEED TO STUDY MORE!  If it is a matter of "accords" ...keep signing thousands of "accords" !!!  None of them said or stablishes HOW! to control world climate at YOUR LEASURE!!  Finally ...the PLANET IS NOT!

Have you wondered how life managed to survive much higher CO2 levels than 440 ppm? More than 1000 ppm ? Have you wondered how life managed to survive a sea level that was 100 feet higher than now? Are you aware all those dooms day 'predictions' are based on inadequate global system computer models? Jimmy, you're part of the fear mongering political and corporate mechanism. Do you really think humans are so fragile that they are no longer able to adapt to Earth changes? You're afraid of change, Jimmy. That, and the fact that you are a political and corporate tool by spouting all that nonsense.
Joseph Vice	Preach it brother
Chris B	The UK, the US and the Australian governments are all currently enacting policies which directly contradict the recommendations of the IPCC. We have 12 years to act. The clock is ticking ...
suresh thota	we can cut global emissions in half before trump leaves office. the key word is "we". if we all go vegan. it takes 2 weeks or 2 months to go vegan. not decades. if we go vegan. the amount of farm land required will be cut in half because we don't need all that land to feed animals. we can covert it back to forests and that alone will cut net global emissions in half. the second half is the difficult part that requires govt and companies involved to fix our energy systems.
frantisek petrasek	Co2 Is food for plants!!!
Ben Simo	The people making these alarmist claims now are the same ones that said the polar ice caps would be melted and florida would be submerged by this time.  I'm not a climate change denier but the history of incorrect climate change disaster predictions is quite long
Luke Ashton Ford	These climate deniers haven't got a brain cell as long as the corporations and banks are making the money they don't give  a jot to what damage they are causing unfortunately we are f-cked
bobby galvin	Honestly I sat here, at the start of this video, and wondered how you put this on Obama. You are starting to become obsessed with blaming him, and Clinton, for everything
chetzmom 4	Has anyone seen Soylent Green? It's set in 2022.  I've been saying this for years...that is a movie of what is to come. The globe will rid itself of the humans, and another lifeform will emerge.  The mega rich will cloister themselves in skyscrapers, with a few soldier/slaves to care for them. They rest of us are doomed.  Other than a MASSIVE GLOBAL INITIATIVE we are doomed. Humans' greed is more important than their need to survive as a species.

eclectic earthlover	On the subject of how we might feed ourselves in a way that is better for the planet, I keep hearing, in left circles, about meat consumption being an environmental problem. I am familiar with some other viewpoints that seem to be ignored or unknown. Have you all checked out PERMACULTURE? Something like that needs to replace agriculture as we know it (not just industrial agribusiness, agriculture as it's been done for millennia). Should grazing animals be a part of that sort of permaculture system? Lots of people believe they have to be, to better imitate natural systems. Should herbivores all be protected from carnivore predation and be allowed to die of old age? How do you think the ecosystem would handle that? And, can my three cats, as well as myself, die of old age please and not malnutrition? Check Joel Salatin, Alan Savory, Chris Kresser, and too many permaculture vids on youtube to really keep up with.
Godzilla Burger	Where is the data that says we are 2 degrees above normal? As far as I know, we are only 0.14 degrees above normal...and this has been this way for a decade. They've been saying this shit for 15 years. Don't get me wrong, I think rebuilding the energy infrastructure is long overdue, BUT there is record snow and cold around the world in AUGUST. The polar sea ice level is RISING. Snow on Antarctica is INCREASING. Look it up. University of Georgia (iirc) has been publishing this for months.  The meat industry is fucked. Strip mining on land and sea is fucked. But the climate is influenced by the SUN. We are NOT the warmest ever. Not by far. Look it up. This is more fear-mongering and Jimmy is a patsy and he doesn't even know it yet. Too bad he didn't look into this data more.
Osama Number5	Here's the real deal.. It's way worse that IPPC states. They are sliding the baseline from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the middle of the 18th Century to the 1850–1900 average. If you use the real baseline of 1760 we are already at 1.3º C warming. Forget 2100 or even 2050 or even 2030. We are toast in a less than a decade.

Johnathan _	The central, fundamental divide on the left: Should we setup a third party? If I were in a corporation and I wanted a radical new direction for than the committee and the CEO, would I spend years lobbying each chair and biding my time for another chance at a failed buyout or would I quit to start my own IP under a new name? The choice becomes even more clear if I know, like Bernie in 2016, I have access to an unlimited source of capital through my own personal credit connections. But yeah, working with the Democratic party was a GREAT decision.
John Tarr	Please check out the YouTube channel of @suspicious0bservers. This brilliant man uses science and the electromagnetic connection to our star to explain the weather beautifully. We definitely need to quit polluting but it in no way is changing our weather on the global scale. Our star is going to sleep and our magnetic field that keeps are atmosphere together is weakening. He has 350k subscribers and i wish more people knew about Ben Davidson.
Luther Dean	i agree w you jimmy
revmansolution	The IPCC is the marketing arm of the slave traders. The climate is changing but not the way you think. Polar ice caps are expanding. Don’t put your long John’s away just yet.
Nick Gardner	Jimmy, read up about the Eocene. Carbon dioxide and temperature levels far, far higher than today but the earth was a verdant planet with forests growing right up to the Arctic and on Antartica. There was little or no ice anywhere, and no land was locked up in a permafrost as we have today. Coral reefs were to be found all over the planet outside of the polar regions. As now, it was a beautiful planet. Sea levels were a lot higher so New York, London, Tokyo, Sydney etc etc would be fine diving sites. The earth will be just fine, the risks are only to us.
Franky Flowers	does anyone know what the climate is supposed to be set at?.maybe it should be warm with no ice caps like it has been before.
Artstrology	My home town of Poland NY has history written at formation of 200 foot white pine trees. The tallest now is 60 -100. and there are hardly any left
Frank Saxon	Lefties have gone full retard with this theory. If it is true, then why are they cutting the rain forests and growing that soy more and more? Why are they demanding that we import millions of people from poor countries so they can consume 1000 times more energy living in western nations?
Matt Purvis	We're so fucked. Glad I don't have any kids.
M Rede	What's the best argument that we are not in any danger due to atmsph carbon buildup whatsoever? Because if there is any risk of a climate fckup, the cost will be well, you know. So if you advocate not changing anything, please answer that.
Neculta	If you deny climate change you belong in a Concentration camp. Our world is dying and our species is in danger, i have had enough of this shit, there is no more room for nonsense. its time to start killing people.
Blither box	FTW.
James Bond	Fuck the earth, I rather have a ham sandwich!
Michel Foucault XVI	This is wonderful news !
Nial Elkim	What does the mistreatment of animals in research facilities have to do with climate change? Veganism is the left’s abortion issue. Its funded to divide us & profit cheap food companies, its not supported by the science, & it drives me crazy. We need to start grazing llivestock on unfarmable land all over the world to sequester carbon & for our health. Don’t listen to the fanatics.
R D Reeves	Thevenusproject.com
Phil Sarazen	Program for change: 1. Every politician and military general must wear lie detector and mind-reading devices and be open to random questioning from the public. 2. release of classified military technology and the development of fusion, small-scale and large.
ilfark2	While reforesting is a good idea, all the calculations to date show we wouldn't be able to do enough fast enough. Added is the difficulty that most plants are sequestering less carbon in higher temps, higher CO2 concentrations.   I've seen various carbon capture from the atmosphere methods in papers, but then don't hear about them again, so it seems possible? It seems we should be able to capture infra red radiation before it goes back into the atmosphere, and/or capture sunlight before it gets a chance to produce infra-red... of course this would entail a massive number of devices. could also pump heat (and make electric with it) from the ocean... but again, the necessary scale would lead us to WWII level mobilization
huepix	Unfortunately your spot on Jimmy. The world is run by the mafia. All around the world governments are simply national Mafioso
Larry Rosenblatt	I watched Nelly live in NYC when she was in "Old Hats"! She is unbelievably smart and witty, so glad you guys have her on. I had such a crush on her in high school
Mr Gone	When industries like fracking produce more air pollution than all the automobiles in Dish, Texas (see gasland) - the average person should not be the first one called upon to make sacrifices.... the burden has to fall on big business. Quit saying we... blame big oil for killing the electric car (see who killed the electric car). The American people do not have an anti-fracking anti-oil candidate. I'm not about to quit eating meat while those assholes sit back and continue polluting.
meermuizen	`Global Warming is a massive industry , a tax collector and yet although there are and will be huge temperature changes , there will be huge disasters of  biblical proportions , all true, but NOT due to global warming !!  We have started on a mini ice age , comparable to the maunder minimum , ours is the Eddie minimum. Throughout history the sun has had its cooling periods , long periods of no sunspots etc , so please do some research or just stick to the words climate change . Till now Al GOres predictions have not come true !! Extinction of the polar bears well just for the record they are doing great ! Time to discover the truth my friends. Eyes open , No fear
Chantal Exposé	I *trusted* this channel until you *started* defending the climate change *nonsense* ..   I now *seriously* question your *judgement* on *anything* ..!!

Gregory O'Brien	The Kyoto Agreement was long before Copenhagen, you beautiful idiot
joseph bendzinski	I guess we had all tear down our houses and move into tents.  Also get rid of all cars and walk.  Jimmy when this horror does not happen what are you going to do with your tent.
LibertyMatrix	I learned of this in 2012. Many of the self-reenforcing, positive feedback loops are already in full effect. Methane, the ticking time bomb. We could have possibly done something back in the 70s.  Now we're in the sixth extinction event. Sad!
A. Randomjack	Heat waves, droughts and floods will kill a lot and already displace millions. Agriculture is beginning to collapse (check Europe, California, Canada...  Most will die from famines or fight for food and water. A stupid bunker won't save you for long...
Nunnles	There are tipping points for all kinds of feedback loops starting as low as 1.5 degrees. It's entirely possible that reaching 2 degrees warming guarantees another couple degrees warming; nobody knows for sure.
jjutt87	The documentary is called 'Salt of The Earth'
Bundle of Perceptions	We are already at 2 degrees warming.  Just stop burning coal and let the aerosols drop out of the atmosphere, and the global temperature will be 2 degrees C above pre-industrial average, not the 0.9 - 1.3 degrees they claim we are at.  That's why we are blowing past the tipping points:  ice is melting, methane is being released from ice shelves and permafrost, forests are starting to die off, and wildfires are getting more intense.  The aerosols have tamped down the temperature for a while, but it is now being overpowered by more and more CO2, so the temperature will begin to rise again at a faster pace.  Nothing short of removing a massive amount of CO2 out of the atmosphere will have any effect on the outcome we face.  Removing that amount of CO2 will cost trillions of dollars, so fugetaboutit!
Jeff Christian	The IPCC is a best-case scenario. Climatologists on the forefront of climate change science will tell you that the IPCC report is pure fantasy and get ready to kiss your ass goodbye in the next few years.

thomas clare	Jimmy,two weeks ago three activists were jailed for sitting on top of a truck stopping them entering a fracking site in Lancashire England,the same judge set free two paedophiles,gave them community orders and put on the sex offenders list,Last week the area they are fracking suffered 4 mini quakes,these bastards at the top are laughing at us,knowing we wont do anything like string the bastards up
Jonathan Vince	What you are saying will happen in Ten years NOT 20 or 30 years if we humans keep the same things going on. Nuke Power is a huge factor to harming the planet. Because it is HOT and takes extremely  long time to cool any thing nuclear as in radioactive.  Countries have been dumping the wast in to the sea in concrete Blocks. Then there is the coal and oil to run everything disaster is looming. Time for peoples inventions to be used that run on none pollution fuels.
Marina Andreazi	sebastião salgado is the brazilian photographer she is mentioning.
Frank van Hoof	weird that 2 degrees will kill millions when it was 5 degrees warmer 2500 years ago.
jimmy bead	Jimmy! thank you for doing this! we need an ecologically regenerative agricultural system. It would take immediate action in creating more small-scale local organic food systems utilizing ecologically and socially regenerative ideas. No-till farms like Singing frogs farm, Neversink farm and the broadfork farm are building soils and storing carbon and sharing how to do it. It would take people consuming less energy and natural resources. Back to living simply within the ecological cycles and functions. The problem is that people don't look in their own lifestyle to do what they can to support those striving for better systems (worker owned, fairtrade, organic, regenerative, sustainable, healthy) and avoiding and divesting from those using destructive systems (corporate industrial chemical agriculture, processed junk food, fast food, corporate industrial food distributers). But people don't wanna change and grow their own food or cook their own food or find an ethical job and boycott corrupt corporations making all this happen. Who do you think funded the environmental situation we're in? ITs all of us. Living off the systems destroying the planet. ANd until people accept that and find as many ways to change their own decisions and lifestyle and become whistleblowers in their own lives, this course we are heading down will only get worse, you can talk about it until you're red in the face but until you do something you're doing nothing.
Maxwell Hoffman	Nellie rocks haha
soraya bradley	Hey Jimmy try engaging with 'Kiss the Ground', or 'Soil Carbon Cowboys' or 'Singing Frog Farms' .or cafe gratitude ... try watching Christine Jones or Gabe Brown - Farmers are going bankrupt with synthetic imputs which are destroying the carbon content of the soil.  (so conservatives/capitalists farmers are failing due to corporate lies) ...  Animal waste and compost is needed to grow good root structure and use photosynthesis to grow food and draw carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere and restore it to the soil. Agro-ecology and regenerative agriculture experts say if we drawdown 4 per 1000 of carbon - we can offset greenhouse emissions. Corporates would have you believe that synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and monoculture is the way to farm - its not, its destroying diversity, destroying soil microbial life and polluting our waterways .... its not the cow, its the how.
delosombres	Lol. People in the US don't even care about being pushed into illegal wars by foreign nations as well as about corruption in politics and supporting dictators, do you think they're gonna care what will happen after 50 years? Hahaha...
AngryLotus	You know, for decades I have been arguing with people online and irl with a simple question. I don't care if we are causing it or not, why aren't we even attempting to do anything about it?! Nothing. Zero. Our pathetic attempt at staving off our own destruction, to me, means we more than deserve EXACTLY what we are heading towards. Better luck next attempt humans, some will survive and try again in a few 10s of thousands of years. This session is well and truly past worth saving.
James	Of course the most important video Jimmy ever puts out and it gets tons of dislikes from right wing trolls who don't want to come to terms with the environmental reality of the contemporary world.
Jeffick The Muhka	No one has yet been able to explain to me how we (humanity) managed to bring the last ice age to an end 12 thousand years ago. The world gets hot, the world gets cold. That’s how the earth is, ups and downs. But of course, man is to blame, not the earth and volcanoes, the sun or other factors that are beyond our control.
Alex Ventura	THIS IS WHERE I DISAGREE WITH YOU JIMMY GLOBAL WARMING IS A BANKER HOAX IT'S NOT AS BAD AS THEY SAY IT IS MOST OF THE THE ENVIRONMENTALIST WORK FOR THE ELITE THEY WANT US TO LIVE IN CAVES !!!!
gyuuk	With geoengineering we can’t trust anything related to weather or climate change
TheHugginMonkey625	We need something like the Venus Project.
TheGr8stManEvr	This is why I don't recycle or conserve or anything like that, because we're all doomed and I've known that for years. I know what the less intelligent 3/4 of our society are like. Even if I work as hard as I can to mitigate my personal carbon footprint it's going to be more than offset by the people in our society who either think climate change is a hoax or think it's real but don't care. Then the U.S. has a choice between Trump or the Democratic candidate who wanted to export Fracking all over the world.  In my hometown the municipal government did a survey on transit and the people overwhelmingly told them they wanted a high frequency transfer based system and our city council and transit management basically said "fuck that, we're just going to do token changes to the shitty system we have now." and so no one who can afford a car uses the bus because our system is terrible. And that's just one city of 400k people, think of all the other terrible decisions taking place all over the world.  Basically me recycling and conserving is like being on the Titanic after the iceberg hit, and I'm bailing out water with a bucket. Meanwhile half of the passengers are bailing water IN TO the boat and then there are a bunch of those fire fighter boats shooting tons and tons of water a second down into the ship. No thanks, I'm gonna grab some brandy and a cigar, sit down in a comfortable chair and listen to the band play "nearer my God to thee." as we go down.
Garry Cole	The thing is that the right wing knows it is coming but the rich oligarchs have already started on their "survival bunker". They have spent millions of dollars on them and meanwhile selling to the stupid fascist Christian right that climate change is a hoax. It is ironic because isn't it like Noah building the ark and warning other people about the incoming disaster? Instead this Noah is a billionaire and building his ark and telling the public oh yeah everything is okay while he smiles and planning for his survival and their doomed.
Maskddingo	So if everyone ate nothing but plants, that would somehow increase the supply of plants?
BB1349	Stef is just Jimmy Dore in a wig
GEZZA1	They will need lottttts of fossil fuel to rebuild infrastructure. We aint going to change without WW3 . Dont bother explaining all this to sheeple.
James B	The IPCC report is authored by as many non-scientists as scientists and is, simply/directly stated, a political (not scientific) document. The feedback loops are ever-present and don’t need a 2 degree warming to “begin”. The most harm this report does (more than ignoring much of the relevant climate data) is refocus all environmental conversation away from POLLUTION, which is just as urgent but completely ignored. Rest assured, we will do nothing about climate change nor pollution and we’ll just sit and wait for everything to devolve into chaos and war. Cornel West for President, Richard Wolf for VP (or visa Versace, doesn’t really matter).
Virgo Atheist0971	We are fucked, to be sure... With the topsoil in imminent danger, given less than 70 years of useable topsoil left, yet no one discusses population control, and how we actually feed 8 billion people... Eating carbs isn’t the way to freedom either, but America doesn’t do anything intelligently. Just look back through history, and see how dumb we are. The Dust Bowl was a man-made ecological event, and in the last 100 years, we doubled down. The decline of America is well underway, and I really think it’s about to get far worse, in a hurry.
Lisa Warren	Jimmy please look into why they came up with climate change. It's a lie. Why won't you talk about Geoengineering, HAARP and Nexrad is the cause. The U.N. is on board with this. This is Agenda 21, NWO. Why won't you report on this. Disappointed in you. You are closing your eye's to the truth. It is a crime against humanity. Look up Davis Keith from Harvard. Listen to Kevin Shipp, ex CIA whistle blower. Listen to Rosalind Peterson expert in Agriculture. Wake up please. Won't listen to video lie's.
toketeeman1016	Thank gawd I've kept a return  ticket back to my home planet  . . .
pokerace420	I remember in school when they told us all the ice caps would be melted by 2016.... well it's 2018 and now your saying 2 to 3 decades... I wonder if in 30 years they will be telling us how at this rate we will melt all the ice in 30 years.
equinos111	Human extinction for a dollar
No Body	Get this into your head Jimmy.  There is no way that humans can control the temperature of this planet.  None.  If you truly believe CO2 is a toxin that will kill all of us then go plant a bunch of trees.  Trees use CO2 and sunlight to create breathable air through photosynthesis, everyone knows this.  Paying more taxes does not create oxygen or reduce CO2.  Plant trees or stop breathing are your only two options.  Carbon taxes and banning straws are a scam.  These people will take all your money and do nothing to help you.  They are scaring you into increased taxes to make you feel good but 99% of the world does not care about global warming.  They are poor and they only care about surviving. Take responsibility if you believe global warming is real.  Go get some seeds and go plant a million trees.  Otherwise you are wasting your life man.  When did liberals start buying into end of the world prophets selling salvation at the cost of more and more money.  Sounds pretty basic to me.  You are getting scammed.

bossdrax	FAKE science,
haplon	jimmy dore believes in science folks. if youve got a problem with that -> fuck right off back to some bowtie wearing gimps funded by exxon plz thx
bsdguy	Jimmy, are you aware of those fake emails from the climate "scientist" in the UK? We have to question the data from all those guys!
jerry kowalski	Dore. You have bought the biggest scam the rich man has ever pulled on mankind. It’s really surprising cuz I thought u were a objective common sense type guy. Why don’t they call it global warming anymore? Do u know? Climate change is nothing more then a method for the elite to contain and control us more than they already do. Do u really not see it? It’s a giant tax on the 99% to funnel more money to the 1%. Jimmy. How has climate change effected u personally? What have u truly witnessed with ur own eyes? Answer these questions honestly.
Rock'on	We need to address Real pollutant  like mercury and lead in water, not a pollutant that you produce while breathing, Tax on CO2 is a tax on Oxygen, because the CO2 come from Oxygen consumption. Most of CO2 come from industries... taxing them will result in a rise on product prices, and we, the people will end up paying this tax on food, clthing, electronics.... In what way it will reduce CO2 emission.... help me.   Just put regulation to eliminate all pollutant from industries... And I would begin with industries dumping waste in rivers everywhere in the world. Then the air. THEN  you charge FINES on people polluting our planet.       What the media are doing right now is shaming people for living their lives.  Your 15 minutes drive to go to work IS NOT the cause of the apocalypse.
Janis w	There was also an instance where orange rinds from an orange juice processor were dumped in an area with dead soil, a few years later, a robust forest.
Carl Spackler	Jimmy,  the UN is trying to rob us. None of this is legit.   Talk about using scare tactics.  I thought you were smarter than that.
imsweetleaf	Nellie gets it....
John Dickinson	4:30 more precisely: *positive* feedback loops.  negative feedback loops stabilize a system. positive feedback loops destabilize a system.  examples of positive feedback loops in earth's climate system: - climate change => icecaps melt => water gets darker (albedo drops) => less sunlight is reflected back into space, more sunlight is absorbed (i.e. turned into heat) => climate change - climate change => tundra permafrost melts => methane gas released into atmosphere => climate change - climate change => change in rain patterns => desertification => less CO2-uptake and sedimentation from plants => more CO2 in atmosphere => climate change - climate change => warming of ocean water => lower ability of water to absorb CO2 => degassing of CO2 from ocean into the atmosphere => climate change  there are negative feedback loops as well which help to stabilize the climate system. But there's no reason to assume that the negative feedback loops will magically intensify when the positive feedback loops do.   And then there is also hysteresis: If the jetstream were to drastically slow down due to a warming of the arctic regions that would most likely be a permanent shift that will not be able to be reset by any means we know of. The effects would be fairly quick and irreversible.
Ryan Boone	Climate change is a joke.. We live under a firmament and they are spraying chem trails in our skies everyday.. how tf are we supposed to judge the climate when that is going on?
physicas	They keep moving the baseline.  Pre industrial baseline that was originally (b/c it's far more relevant) was a century before the baseline temp being used now. Industry (everything you live your lives with) is killing everything regardless of CO2 and global temps.
Travis Norseman	Come on Jimmy, you call out propaganda everyday but you want to support this BS. It's nothing more than a propaganda scam for a GLOBAL TAX on carbon, in other words, everything.
TheHealthPhysicist	Trump: "Make America Venus Again!"...and the rest of the planet, too.
Frank Castle	It seems that the climate science deniers are out in full force today - unable to accept what's right in front of their faces.  And yes, I know that emissions taxes are a scam to capitalize on the crisis - from where I stand it's probably too late to stop the climate from shifting anyways...
Star Messenger	Nellie, I think the documentary you were trying to remember is called, "Chasing Ice". Google it.
Mat J	WHy aren't you vegan yet jimmy?
Pizza Jedi	Global warming is a real problem. But not for the reasons stated. Geo Engineering is the primary cause of the radical climate change on planet earth! Not farting cows! Just look up. The planes are spraying the shit out of us every single day! Agenda 2030 is the reason they want us to change our diet, live in micro apartments, restrict our travel. This is about control not saving the planet!
Mike Grant	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA5sGtj7QKQ ooh look a phd climate scientist.
Pete	I like Jimmy Dore. As far as intelligence, I like James Corbett more. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA8n9fm5fwE
CommanderXED	Two facts everyone should know, which counters the global warming catastrophe "myth"! .  One:  The Arctic ice sheet (i.e. the North Pole) melts and refreezes almost every year.  Two:  The average daily temperature over the Antarctic Ice Sheet (the South Pole) is NEGATIVE 56 degrees fahrenheit.  Given that a 2 degree increase in temperature would have almost no effect on the South Pole and be HARMLESS.  Prove me wrong!
William Calhoon	Dr. Guy McPherson (website "Nature Bats Last") sums it up best, "On the edge of extinction only love remains".  What Dr. McPherson points out is sea level rise is meaningless because humans will be long gone before coastal cities flood.  Why?  As global temperatures rise the heating of inner continents will destroy the grain crops.  Rice, wheat, corn, soybeans will no longer be able to be grown.  No grains, no Homo sapiens.  So starvation is the what the coming apocalypse is all about.  When will this begin?  Dr. McPherson estimates we will lose summer arctic ice maybe as soon as 2019 but definitely no later than 2026.  With our global air conditioner gone it won't be long before runaway climate change takes us all down.

Bernie	The planet is fucking melting.. HOWEVER, my neighbors (who are Republicans) actually get it and installed solar on their roof. I had a white metal "green" roof done in 2017 and I am getting solar next year. The batteries will be next. My landscape went from 1/2 acre of energy/time/noise dependent lawn to almost all native plant species to support wildlife and onsite water retention pond since I live next to the impaired Caloosahatchee River. I grow most of my own vegetables/fruit and have dramatically reduced meat consumption. Divestment retirement from fossil fuels is another way to make change.
poofendorf	These politicians that refuse to act should be arrested.
Doug Graves	it's profit at a cost and in that is not profit at all. Back our money with the health of the planet. So clean up efforts creates new money--WITH NO DEBT ATTACHED! That is real wealth in my book because I'd know with each dollar printed the Earth only gets better and safer. This is the only way out, folks!
Mr Boompi	Jimmy I love you to death, but you have been taken in by the UN and their unscientific bullshit.  The only thing that will be catastrophic is the globalist tax increases and totalitarian control thee people seek to foist upon us.  The catastrophic warming "forecasts" you mention will not occur.  They are not supported by either historical data or atmospheric measurements.  Over the past 10o years, there has been a little overall warming, between .5 and 1.0 deg C.  The hot decade of the 1930s occurred before the levels of CO2 were "affected" by human activity.   In fact, the data supports the fact CO2 has nothing to do with whatever climate change we are experiencing.  Please look around for the truth about climate change.
NotTheOne% Guy	The Earth doesn’t care about people. When we die off, the Earth has 100’s millions of years left to do its thing.

rhialobran	Your president has a plan to stop global warming. He's pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, it's called nuclear winter and our government supports it!

jody ratcliffe	Climate genocide?
jfuite	Wow, that guest.  I suppose she wanted to talk about reforestation and animal testing no matter what.
The Compassionate World	Jimmy, you interviewed Peter Joseph who detailed the proper action. Capitalism must be eliminated and replaced with a Resource Based Economy. Money cannot be the center of civilization any longer. Science must take over and do the rebuilding. And you are right just as Peter has always expounded. Voting in the current system will solve nothing. How about another interview with Peter and then follow it up with constant support towards an RBE?  A short video that explains. We either place science at the center of civilization or we die. https://youtu.be/yqnXkSlxHx4
Janette Shultz	Here we go again. Farming. You're playing into the hands of commercial farmers.
Pablo Pastor	What fake jew wrote these lies? The goal is reduction in CO2 from PEOPLE. A talmudic script.
Charles Holzschuh	China consumes more beef than any other country. The same is true for oil. You are spitting on a forest fire.
Rollin Shultz	I up voted the video and you all made some great points. I thoroughly disagree with the UN's climate models and find they have proven time after time to be drastically incorrect. That being said I am a fervent proponent of mankind living in harmony with nature. some time ago I realized there was a bait and switch that took place and it was arranged by major corporations. Environmentalists were making much progress at curbing major polluters due to a program where they could get reward money for exposing corporate pollution. So said major corporations funded climate change studies to promote the evils of climate change which they would blame on everything but themselves and also provide the solution in the form of carbon trading schemes which would for a small percentage of their profits, allow them to continue polluting.  Those corporations own governments and no method of giving governments more power will enable mankind to reverse this progress of living against nature. MY solution is based on personal responsibility. Consumers must take responsibility for every dollar they spend to defund the major polluters by not buying their stuff. For Americans this means not automatically buying imported goods. Though some things must be imported such as coffee, and rubber, most things such as furniture and most foods can be made here in our country. The benefits to changing our spending behavior are: 1. Less pollution and resource wasting burning diesel fuels to transport unnecessary goods around the world. That also goes for poisoning of the oceans buy exporting our recycling over seas on open barges through storms etc. 2. We can lessen the impacts of all industries by consuming less and wasting less. If we don't buy stuff they won't make it. 3.  By purchasing fresh foods at local markets, we can save much on such impacts as huge amounts of refrigeration of transported and stored foods. We also would eliminate the need for plastic packaging. Your local farm markets typically wrap your goods in some easily and locally recyclable butcher paper, and for more friendly methods,we could use returnable ceramic pots and urns for soups, coffee beans, and other items. 4. We can exit the beat the Jones' race and stop trying to have everything we see. Before industry less people had everything they wanted. If you wanted a piece of furniture, you contracted a local tradesman to make it for you out of often locally sourced materials. It therefore was more expensive to obtain, but after having spent a month to two of pay for one piece, you had tremendous respect for your stuff. It didn't mean you could never have what wealthier people have, it just meant you couldn't have it all right away. Aside from the immediate gratification there is up side to buying cheap goods that last a few years and which you get tired of after a few years because there was no sacrifice to obtain them.  I am trying to make the point that it is not the responsibility of those outside of ourselves to make the needed changes. It makes no sense to me so many people cry about climate change and when I drive by Walmarts and other mega stores the lots are always full. I get this image of someone holding a government please help sign in one hand and a knife at their throat in the other. You can't even blame it in industry itself for being greedy and underhanded in their dealings by bribing government and brainwashing the people through TV commercials created by marketers with psychology degrees. It is the nature of industry. Industries are constantly pushing an envelop of saturation and they must constantly compete for market share, so profits must come first. They are in a constant flux of building more factories to get more market share, which requires more loans and profit loss, plus the cost of bribing officials, advertising etc. The only way to defeat any industry is defunding. (stop buying their stuff!) I am no Ludite. I embrace good technology and avoid the bad. We are very fortunate we can have computers and live somewhere in the mountains in a log cabin simultaneously. I believe every homeowner should take responsibility for producing their own power, using solar, wind and whatever they can. Homeowners could plan that into the cost of buying a home. If your budget is say $200K, you might expect to invest 40% of that in energy production. So you buy a $120K house and invest $80K in energy independence. That way it is planned into the mortgage.  So I say forget "Climate Change" instead strive to live in harmony with nature individually. Give you business to local farmers and businesses and only such factory producers that are responsible with the environment, and I mean really, not just that's what they claim or because they donate a little money to the odd tree planting etc. Open your eyes to where your money goes and what it accomplishes for whom.
Vadios83	Its baffling... he understands how the media lies and how propaganda works... but when its global warming he believes all the bullshit. Doesn't he know that hundreds of millions americans will die by the year 2000 cause of global warming? Oh no wait that was cause of overpopulation and mass starvation cause we can't feed all these people. The poles are going to be completely ice free, our children wont know snow... damn why are people who should know better so dumb on that issue.

Agent Smith	The "Patriots" have already forgotten about the record worldwide heatwaves, floods, draughts, storms, and wild temp swings this year, last year, and so on. Some are predictably admitting its real, but of course raising the greenhouse gas CO2 levels to 400ppm has nothing to do with it. Later, theyll admit their big ass stupid trucks were tge problem, but white jesus will save them....Not You!
Vegan Marine	Thank you for bringing up the Agg industry Jimmy!
Darren	And where do these projections and predictions, which is all they are, come from? From computer models right? Models that have been found to be completely unreliable and flawed. But we're supposed to take these "scientists" word on it who have been completely wrong thus far? Didn't scientists say back in 2000 that we were supposed to be under water 4 years ago?
Hans Marheim	The average American eat to much and shit to much. The american agricultural industrial complex is trying to export those unnatural practice to the Asian world for profit. When the Chinese consumer reaches the same abusive habits as Americans, there's no way back. UN should build a big beautiful wall all around USA.

eric moss	I think the photographer Nellie is talking about may be Sebastio Salgado.  Anyway, I decided 30 years ago we were doomed.  It wasn't some glib "oh I know that nothing matters", but I saw how those who tried to change got treated.  That was the last chance we really had to avoid the mass extinctions -- now we'll be lucky to avoid human extinction.  Civil society will be toast in much of the world unless we eat the rich.
David Hinojosa	How do you tell your  children not to have children?
ErisLee	It’s not simply human caused CO2. Extreme climate changes occur during grand solar minimum cycle shift, polar shifts. Move inland or prepare for repetitive mass floods, but not too far up north or prepare for ice storms like never seen before. You silly humans who think a political policy will save the planet won’t survive if you don’t prepare now. Government isn’t gonna save you.

Anthony Bilello	The good news is Antarctica is growing ice. The bad news is the model in which the information is extracted from is completely wrong. We are headed for an ice age, not a global melt down. The amount of green house gasses  800 years ago was almost double what it is now. Propaganda from big brother. Imagine the amount of green house gasses released by active volcanos... it dwarfs anything we do! Don't believe the hype. Antarctica is growing ice! Also, the more gasses you have the more sun light is reflected back from our atmosphere. Once again, not by fire but by ice! I dare anyone to do a little investigating. Actually, I beg everyone to do investigating. Propaganda. Why wouldn't they lie? Oh, wait I forgot... the government is here to help us!
akaElleLatham	You should check out Corbett Report.
Brandon Lee Sanders	Climate change is evolutionary and more dependent of factors such as energy output from the sun and our orbital precession than man made factors. We are naive to think humans have any control over climate. Yes we need to always conserve and keep our planet clean but climate change must be differentiated from conservation.
hizzle mobizzle	It's even worse than you think.  Even if we do all the things necessary to combat climate change we still have Fukushima to deal with.  Fukushima has destroyed life in the Pacific ocean (loss of biomass) and we are being told it would be 40-100 years before they could possibly deal with it.  The radiation being produced by that disaster will kill us all.

Ilfart 218	It is not the meat industry that is responsible for the majority of deforestation. The chemical industry wants to sell their chemicals and they don't care if there is a market for the product of the farmers that use those chemicals. So they clear forests to sell chemicals which 60 percent of which will be thrown away literally not fed to animals. Deforestation is responsible for roughly 98 percent of global warming, reforestation is the only way to reverse this trend as animals are responsible for very little of the greenhouse gas emissions way behind volcanoes geysers and the other naturally occurring greenhouse gas emissions. You can draw a parallel line with decrease in forest biomass and global warming.
John Tyree	Sooo many of the world's problems would be solved if all the republicans, with their greed, denial and ignorance were raptured up to Mars.

All  making them and their extremely subservient friends, and families extremely wealthy.

Jessica Roth	Obama and Clinton sabotaged any chance Copenhagen (2009) had of succeeding, to appease the Chinese.  Then Obama did Paris (2015) on his way out the door, effectively, to cover his ass on this issue.  Which is why Obama can suck shit.  James Hansen, the leading climatologist at NASA, spent 2006-2008 telling us that if we didn't do anything by 2012, we were irreparably fucked.  Shrub Bush spent that time trying to silence Hansen, of course.  And all it cost us was our planet.  Meanwhile, MSDNC will try and pin this on Trump.  That's like blaming Bandera and the Ukrainian collaborators for Nazism.  They were definitely evil and they didn't make things better, but the problem was there long before that.
Boutneus12	Ofcourse fucking with the planets temperature on a GLOBAL scale will have a lot more unforseen consequences then we can wrap our monkey brains around.

Ashley Nevins	Sounds like the Great Tribulation in the book of Revelations in the Bible.   Worse than this is coming. Tip of the iceberg is climate change (pun intended).   Yes, I know, atheists don't believe me. https://www.openbible.info/topics/those_who_dont_believe  Denial of the end of days is an interesting phenomenon to watch as all the signs show themselves.   Thanks, Jimmy, for pointing out one of the signs. It's obvious what is taking place and so will be what is yet to come as its devastation's come. Yet, as it comes it will be denied as to what is really taking place.   Politics is not going to save mankind from itself. Politics is not God. Some like to make it their god.   Will a one world far left progressive socialist and green government save the world? It believes it can. That thinking is the set up for a dictatorship that the book of Revelations speaks too. You only have to look as far the UN to see how well that will work.   The picture is larger than the non believers  believe it to be. They can only point to symptoms of what I am speaking as they deny what I am speaking too as to what is actually taking place. The Bible tells us what is coming and did long before climate change people and the far left, greens and progressives did.   A persons political righteousness will not save that person in the end. This world is passing  away and the Bible explains why it is. There is only one way to God through Jesus Christ. He is the only hope.   Something happened in 1948 that changes everything today. A prophesy was made true. More will be coming true. We are on the precipice now. It's all coming together as the Bible explains it and warns! That warning is magnitudes larger and more important than any UN panel can come up with. More than climate change is inevitable.
oldschoolman 144	Humanity is just a blink of the eye in the grand scale of time, the earth will be fine, humanity not so much! The odd thing is that humans think they are so intelligent but if you look around you can see just how destructive we are. It doesn't look good for humanity at the rate we're going. We're going the way of the dinosaurs but by our own hand.

Christopher Anthony Miceli	To add to Nellie McKay about a photographer replanting ... I was watching something several weeks back.. a small doc ... about an Old Man in his 80's 90's somewhere in a village... I think it was in the rainforest where the trees were cut down leaving the land lay barren.... this Old Man saw what it was doing to his village, the soil, the farmers land etc and started planting trees and I think some other vegetation .. The townspeople call him the crazy old man .. after several years the village people started to the results the Old Man had with his planting they were able to flourish again as a community.... the Old Man saved the village and the people......... also watch the documentary "COWSPIRACY." I just looked it up and what I think it is the right video is entitled "The Man Who Stopped The Desert"

ECO SHAH	In 1980, I took part in the surveying of the North West Passage, in the Canadian Arctic.  We calculated the thickness of the ice, depth to the ocean floor and the topography of the ocean floor and below.  This was done specifically at the worst part of winter to calculate the equipment needed to open the passage year round.  Why doesn't the government compare that data to today's reality and prove this bull shit one way or the other.

Lord of the belts: The return of the KING	"we need to change the world system and culture" Why do Americans think they are like the authority on this? America per capita has one of the most primitive high emission systems among all modern countries. You guys are literally the last people to get the right to talk about being smart and preaching to people about their system.   The USA loves to talk about China, but the USA per capita emits literally 2x more CO2 per capita than Japan and China. And Europe also emits more per capita than Japan and China (but Europe still emits less than the USA at least). So you are in no position to pretend to get on your high horse and talk about changing the world's systems, when they are already ahead of you and you are the one stuck in the past.  Japan produces the world's most efficient solar panels and Japan and China have the largest solar power plants.   It's so tiresome to see dumb Americans sit ignorantly around and talk shit about a world they have no education about, when it's their rotten country that is the main problem in all of these things.
Kyle Ganse	It can be fixed because once shit hits the fan then governments and people respond. It’s how humans are we are reactionary never do we all move towards responding to a problem before it manifests it ugly head. Some follow the people speaking the truth but others just like to sit in the comfortability of the same situation.  I also believe everything happens as it’s meant to. The solutions will appear and we will fix it if enough people focus on it. Still means you have to follow your feelings on this subject.
Rowebot Radio	The IPCC stated they dramatized the report intentionally this time to get a bigger response. They are hoping fear will get people to make changes. I bet it backfires. 12 years from now things wont have changed much and people will reject the whole thing, just like last time, and the time before that. Enjoy the ride folks.
bammbamm12	Gammon and spinach. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA8n9fm5fwE&feature=youtu.be  This was a political document. Liberals, when they can't get their way, need to accuse the opposition of being murderers. This gives them the right to self-defense.

Jay Kline	Not worse then some us thought.
MaoTseFunkadelic	They seem to be over-estimating the role of specifically 'animal agriculture', 'factory farming' and deforestation as the source of climate change. It seems like vegan feel goodery.   They reality is that there is hardly any aspect of your life that is not contributing to climate change, as nearly every aspect depends on industrial processes, and nearly every act of consumption adds to incredible piles of waste.  In the first instance, the link between 'deforestation' and 'animal agriculture' is mainly feed crops, largely maize and soya, being planted in greater quantities. Poultry is the prime destination, but the feed conversion ratios for poultry have improved dramatically, I believe around 1.6 now. It is not as if somehow, if it were not for poultry, Brazilian farmers would cease to try and expand their farms into the Amazon. Farming becoming increasingly capital intensive is a feature of capitalism in general. Moreover, you can moralize about people eating too much meat, but this feed is increasingly being geared to feeding China, because, surprise surprise, it is one of the cheapest forms of protein. Not because people are greedy obese mofos.  Moreover, pasture based animals are often the only form of 'agriculture' that is viable for small farmers, particularly in relatively drier areas. If you want large numbers of psuedo-peasant farmers to simply stop producing cattle, while you by-god better be prepared to give them a decent income that will equate to the amount food, traction, and exchange value they get from their animals. Step foot in a rural are in Asia or Africa and tell people they are dipshits for producing animals and they will rightly laugh at you.  This, obviously does not apply to beef feedlots, which are the least energy efficient, by a longshot. But these are not all of animal agriculture.   Secondly, on what basis is it being claimed, for example, that deforestation is MORE harmful than the ecological damage to algae and other oceanic plantlife, which occupy a far higher proportion of the Earth's surface?  I get the central point of the video, climate change is coming to get us hard, but this a CAPITALISM problem, not just one of a particular sector's production practices, or of one form of rapacious consumption.

The same establishment that lies about damn near EVERY single thing of human importance is all of a sudden to be trusted in the lie about Climate Change.?!!     Jimmy Dore loves talking about experts/scientists in the intelligence field DEBUNKING the Russia lie and his dismay that the masses still follow/believe the stories of the powers that be.  As such,  you will have someone like Bill Binney being ignored when presenting hard data on that "Russia did it"  lie.   In a similar fashion, for Climate Change,  you have the expert/scientists in that field who adequately present hard data exposing that lie and they are also ignored. Instead, the establishment ruse of the world coming to an end via climate change (Global Warming) continues unabated.  See links below......  1.

He covers the subject in great depth and shows how this was planned by the oil companies in his documentary, how big oil took control of the world. It something like that, can't remember exact name though
Mike G	The UN says so hey, hmmm. Maybe they should tax us more (carbon tax), cause that would help so much. We are seeing climate change yes. It's an cycle, but, I do believe we are speeding it up. Nothing we can do will stop it now, since it is a cycle, but we should stop all the factory farming and such anyway.
Jess Fulbright	Jimmy I love you and this young woman you are speaking with has a good heart and intentions. It saddens me to see that the "Global Warming" conspiracy theory has gotten you too. My fields of expertise are nuclear physics and geology, I worked most of my life in the pursuit of improved worker health and safety but am now retired. For a hobby I started studying global warming in the 1990s; I was already pretty much convinced of AGW but I like data. After 25 years of study I have come to two conclusions. First, there are multitudes of factors that affect global climate and temperature but one stands out far above all the others and that is the sun. Second, the sun is not going to provide any global warming for the foreseeable future.The fact is we are currently entering the bottom of solar cycle 24, which was an extremely weak cycle. Cycle 25 will be lower in amplitude and many are predicting that cycle 26 may be nearly nothing. Solar forcing is diminishing, galactic cosmic rays are increasing and our magnetosphere is collapsing. The planet will cool for the next 25 years (at the very least) due to these factors and in spite of CO2. This trend will not necessarily end in 25 years, earth could easily slide back into a major glaciation. We are after all still living in the Quaternary Ice Age though many do not realize it.This has started already, there is no stopping it. Global temperature has begun to fall and the next two winters will be eye opening as the sun goes completely to sleep between cycles 24 & 25. It is kind of funny the tricks that nature can play on you; since 2007 people have been predicting an ice free arctic and I have heard many lately say next summer or the one after. Reality will be exactly the opposite and by cycle 27 we will have forgotten global warming. Murphy's law says that then the sun will come back to life and all of that new found heat will be trapped by the CO2 we forgot to continue to battle and we will all cook.
JSavic	For India, you’ve got to consider the interaction of heat and sunlight on air pollution.
Michael Price	I Believe we have a Dark Ops Cabal Doing Weather Control or even as Far as Weather Warfare. Just the Iceberg of the Space Force wanted. They have these H.A.A.R.P. Facilities all over the World and what known Satellites that have Direct Energy into the Oceans altering Low Pressure Systems in another Direction & Making High Pressure Systems. I think less of Cemtrails (Exaggerated People Distorting the Truth) They have to put more Heat in our Atmosphere for what they want, so its even done on Purpose. The Global Warming Deniers actually want our Planet Warming Up. (What I think is the Problem)
Marcus Mitchell	Is there a political program created around this? What do we as society need to do to avoid it? What political party can be created to run on this ? Talking about this doesn’t do anything and expecting consumers to change this is a joke.
rickyt43515	Total Bullshit. These so called experts are getting paid to mouth this horseshit so why would they tell the truth that there is no global warming and loose their paycheck? Total crock of bullshit.
osku	Thanks for mentioning the number one cause for climate change: animal agriculture, Jimmy, not just the energy sector, although of course that is very significant too.
PeaceWizard	Have you actually looked at the stats for these reports? Have you actually looked at who funds these studies? I dont think so.... cmon Jimmy look who funds the study you report on...
I Nuke Whales	Even if climate change is not being caused by human activity, they still pose an argument on deforestation and animal agriculture. This shit destroys the environment and it’s ecosystem. Watch Sustainable on Netflix for a point of view on how conventional farming is poison.
PinoyFAid	Are this predictions as bogus as  Al Gores predictions?

Adam Briggs	If you really want to make a difference, eat grass fed/pastured meats because that has a NET NEGATIVE impact on carbon emissions. It's all broken down in the book Defending Beef: The Case For Sustainable Meat Production.
cutterboard	i forsee wars coming to keep people from the most affected countries out of the counties which are still livable. *sigh*… i hoped this would come after i'm dead…
Commercial Art Services Art Work	So what's the solution Jimmy? I'm very concerned that I'm going to hear a response that smacks of the same kind of logic as I've heard before on this show. "Take away people's guns" even though you also say "the system is run by criminals".  So you know the system is run by criminal murderers but you also think we should give up our defense against it? hmmm... So what's your solution to this so I can point out he problems. Please mind you - i'm on the left - the real left that watches out for the fake left controlled opposition. Tell me the solution.
MrPotatochips4	I give thanks to Life, and to Earth, and if I listen to her for awhile, I fear no change.
P1	And this monsters want to "fix it " spraying toxic metals that kills the ecosystem  GEOENGEENERING  is killing the planet even faster, greedy monsters  STOP SPRAYING OUR SKIES!
James Gant	100 corporations reportedly contribute 71% of carbon emissions and the US military much of the rest.   IF everybody in the US was to switch to electric cars and solar panels on their houses with batteries etc. that would only cut emissions by reportedly 20% to 25%.  So when we say that this is a problem of governments you have to consider that there are cartels with more money and power than governments- those corporations.    But a silver bullet in this case would be graphene technologies in graphene super capacitors and solar panels.
Sparky Gump	There are simply too many humans on the planet.

spreadingrumors	Excuse me, Jimmy, but we've already triggered multiple feedback loops.  The climate isn't changing, it's collapsing right now.

Sharon Combs	Nellie's voice can hardly be heard--also, she was almost totally unprepared; frustrating and disappointing!
DeadManAnimations	Death to capitalism; we will survive beyond the bondage of employer and employee. Death to the state; we will survive free from national mythology and violence.   Climate Change can not be stopped by capitalism; only through revolution and socialism can we as a united people survive what we have created.
Tee Hughey	Why does everyone continue to have this conversation without addressing Geo Engineering and Climate Engineering?
Retro Rube	To put it simply, the planet will be fine, humanity is but a fart in the wind in the lifespan of our planet. The planet will kick us to the curb and the only people to blame is ourselves. I'm scared for my little daughter... I'm scared at what she will have to endure in her lifetime due to our selfish tendencies, our ignorance and our ineptitude. We have the power for greatness but settle for mediocrity. I'm changing my diet and habits pronto and everyone out there with a conscience needs to do the same! Not next year, nor next week but now... right now!
Michael Daniel	Once it hits 2C then many self-reinforcing feedback loops kick in and then we'll hit 3 and 4C within a decade.  After that its Katy bar the door.  Bottom line:  Human Extinction this century.  Sorry but it's true.

AeroPwnX	*_Climate change is real and is not limited to Earth, there is absolutely nothing humans can do about this fact. Destroying our planet for profit is absolutely wrong, so is taxing those who are not responsible for the problem. Biodiversity is the measure of our planets health, not temperature or CO2 levels. Overpopulation is the greatest threat to our continued existence, Earth’s existence is not dependent on us._*  Our sun has completed it’s main sequence and has begun fusing helium into carbon. It has started its Red Giant phase where it will balloon in size while surface temperature drops and light output dims because it’s further from the core. Although surface temperature reduction is constant so is expansion, the closer the surface gets to the vicinity of planetary bodies the hotter they get. All the planets in this solar system are heating up simultaneously, this is a fact that CO2 tax supporters/human climate change propagandist continue to ignore or refute.

AGARTHA STUDIO	It has always seemed to me that deforestation is the real problem. We cannot easily replenish forests that have been decimated. It takes centuries. The Powers That Be focus on carbon to pretend they are addressing the issue & make more money, meanwhile they continue to cut down the trees.
Tuonela0	Animal rights activist marginalizes the ideas in this video. I am not against her but the things she is concerned takes away from the main point sometimes.
ubon11	Leonardo, Al Gore, and the rest of Hollywood should jump into their private jets and fly from one of their mansions to the other side of the world to another one of their mansions, while shaming the rest of us into riding the bus, turning off our A/C, and making our lives miserable while they continue their party.   That should make the planet all good, right?

jerry minnie	Hey Jimmy. Glad you were able to get Diane from Cheers as a guest on the show;)
Michelle Espino	We only have one Earth. There is no doubt in my mind that climate change is real. I'm no genius and  I do not claim to be more informed about the climate than 99% of the world's climate scientists. You bet if I thought I was I would be submitting my research for a noble prize or at least for peer review.  But here is the thing even if there were a small chance that we are harming our planet with our pollution and deforestation ( mostly for animal agriculture, ) wouldn't that be worth making a change. I mean don't we put on our seatbelts because of the risk of bodily damage or at least the risk of being pulled over? I wonder why no one argues against this practice. It's most likely because fossil fuel companies aren't campaigning to spread misinformation.
Dirty Mike	Where Jimmy is wrong here is by trusting the IPCC et al. Surprising that someone as aware as he does. The anti-alarmists (the non-profiteering ones) obviously know that polluting is bad and we should be finding cleaner means of energy. However, Carbon is a minor (yet very easily taxed/profited from and easy to find a sympathetic scapegoat [us]) greenhouse gas. Does it factor? Absolutely. But in the multivariate analysis - as proven by the ice cores themselves - it is a more reactive gas to global temp increase than it is a cause for it.   Water vapour/the sun is the PRIMARY culprit here; IF there is critical warming at all - and many studies point to not. Plenty of evidence to support this if one looks beyond he corrupt NOAA/IPCC/NASA info. Show me how we can control the sun's natural effects on our planet...  Does that mean that increased CO2 is a good thing and it won't hurt us eventually? No. But the timeline is something that perhaps 2 generations won't see. The oceans across the world are too dynamic and too deep in 3 dimensions for the IPCC math to work (Look up Dr. Judith Curry).  We've backed the wrong horses in the 'renewable energy' race - wind and solar are wholly unreliable and are also co-opted (look at who holds the patents for most of those and the electric car techs and you might find a recognizable cast of characters). We've also chosen the wrong greenhouse gas as the culprit.   If ppl reading this are not ravenous and dogmatic in their climate beliefs, and are open to challenging information; please go to www.climate4you.com  Very unbiased, fact based climate info.   Also, look in to James Corbett at Corbettreport.com or here on YouTube. Guy is nothing if not thorough in his research. Jimmy, if you read these comments....GET CORBETT ON YOUR SHOW AND DISCUSS CLIMATE POLICY AND BIG OIL ETC. It will be more than worth it!
Tom Kelly	I want to introduce a new idea to the people of the left wing, be careful here because it is a right wing idea.   Take personal responsibility.  Change your diet, buy some solar panels and batteries and grow your own food. Get an electric car.  There are 2 political parties that are not going to save you. Democrats and Republicans. Please stop waiting for some benevolent leader to solve all the worlds problems for you.  Make the necessary changes in your own life. Lead by example and practice what you preach.
antonio jackson	These people who are in charge are dying within that timeframe anyway so they dont give a fuck what happens
FoxTopia Minecraft	Jimmy, we 'thought' we would all be under 30 feet of water at the coast by now, stop being chicken little
Mr. Internet Man	The fact that we're not doing anything is unfuckingreal
Another Agnostic	Now look at Methane release, especially at the latest Methane release because of biofeedback loops.  We. Are. Doomed.
TheOutThere Channel	I just watched life below ep5 current season and the guy said hes not had so much snow on his roof.. hmm more ice..... heat what.... climate change you cant change... only pollution can change.... google professor dyson comments on it.
OSCAR CHAVOYA-ACEVES	Climate scientists and the media have been making a mistake when they address this issue, focusing on temperature instead of internal energy. Let me explain: ice melt at constant temperature (that's thermodynamics) and while it melts its internal energy increases 79.72 kcak/kg, which is enough heat to raise the temperature of one kg of water by 79.72 degrees.  We can expect that we will know what global warming is when the ice is gone. Then we will see the true face of the beast.
Michael Van Ausdall	No conversation about the world climate is valid until taking geoengineering into account
Ryan Jorgensen	This lovely edition of fake news, was bought to you in part, by agenda 21, enviro profiteering and a hidden plot of despotism.
Retalak	Growth for the sake of growth, an inherent contradiction of capitalism, will be the death of us all.
matt walker	Your the person we needed when we needed them most jimmy, your the hero of our progressive movement not bernie.
Beard681	LOL. The problem is democracy, not capitalism. Tell people they can't have cars, or AC, and have to live in a small apartment in a Stalinist style block. If you want to enjoy nature, since you can't travel, you put on a pair of VR googles.  Who would vote for that?  BTW, I live in an apartment and don't own a car. When my kids grew up they couldn't get cars and flee to the burbs fast enough. That is the lifestyle that attracts immigrants by the millions.
Troy Wallace	People  think well its not going to  affect  me
Lawney Malbrough	Stops the bullshit Jimmy. Climatologist knowv that  long before mankind existed the climate was warmer than today. They have discovred that it cyles from warmer to colder fsirly regularly. We can't stop this. We're still coming out of an ice age. Taxing people more is not going to change the planet. All taaxescwill dobisckeep people from having the  money to take steps to protect themselves by moving to a safer area. If you're smart you'll buy land at a higher elevation and move away from the coast. Climate change happens. It's always happened. This is not a new thing. But there's hope. In about a hundred years the planet will start cooling down to another ice age.
Levelminded	Climate change is caused by the sun and its sunspots. There have been times of extreme warm temperature on earth before humans. Just look at the holocene maximum.
Ebon Shadow	The planet is fine, we are fucked.
Unfettered Fire	In an indirect way, Rachel Carson gave us neoliberalism, because her book, Silent Spring, ignited the environmental movement, which forced through protection legislation, which resulted in the impeachment of Nixon by the fossil fuel industry, which spurred the Lewis Powell  "call to arms" for private industry to seize control of government, which exempted legislation so that fracking could destroy US soil, air and water, and the SC could be filled with Koch-appointed judges like Neil Gorsuch (whose mother Anne had to resign in disgrace as EPA head during the Reagan years) and Kavanaugh, who will be focused on repealing Chevron Deference, giving the SC the power to gut the rest of the environmental legislation. Right now, Monsanto/Bayer is riddled with thousands of lawsuits and there's a youth climate movement that wants to bring their case to the SC.  Not all countries are like the US, thank God! In his new book, A New Foreign Policy: Beyond American Exceptionalism, Jeffrey Sachs addresses the fact that "We don't look after each other at all," in America today. We don't because the small radical right group led by libertarian Koch money wants it that way.   Sachs discusses the quality of life and the environmentally-friendly infrastructure in Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen. "They're not falling apart, actually, they're kinda gorgeous!" Every worker enjoys 5 or 6 weeks summer paid vacation as a matter of every workers' right. They are living very, very comfortably and productively.  In other words, they are living in the cleaner, saner 21st century. So why this agenda to hold America back in some Orwellian,  fossil-fuel, soot-soaked neofeudalism?
junior777	300 dollar a gallon gas and the end of any prosperity is what is required, back to communal apartments and bread lines is what the elite want to turn the planet into while they travel on private jets and live in top floor hundred story buildings. And for what? An actual warming of less than half a degree. Keep advocating for this bull shit and your future is a real life hunger games. Wake up idiots
Ellesig	Finally, someone said animal agriculture is a threat, it is the number one threat.  It's not about eating less meat, it's about deprogramming yourself and getting off addicition to animal products and going vegan.

Impossible Windows	Not denying climate change or human's effect on co2 production, but not one of the UN's 32 climate models has ever made an accurate prediction. Too many variables, too many moving parts that we don't truly understand yet... and any sizeable volcanic eruption is like decades of cow farts and 70s muscle cars in perpetuation. No stopping those. Paris accord was a non binding virtue signal and little more. Please Jimmy, give this the same rational scrutiny you give the Russian narrative. This is equal parts quantitative and fear mongering predictions... Amazingly, no banks have hesitated to offer me a loan on beach front property for the last 20 years, thought after watching greedy Gore's flick decades ago that these would be beyond risky dealings... Oh that's right, Gore also bought beach front property with his carbon credit cash windfall. Every comment on here thinks that they 'know' the facts, but truly you all are regurgitating what you've read from the same sources that delivers what we know to be propaganda and bullshit.. The fact is anyone watching this video doesn't wade through the endless data on climate science nor would you understand half of what you're reading. To be fair, nor do I.. but, at least be honest with yourselves... this is nothing more than a belief system. If the data was clear, we'd all believe it and be in fear for descendants... Think the greedy don't care about their offspring as much as you? Tech to scrub co2 from the atmosphere is already in the works as well... relax and be honest with yourselves, leave the TV on for the dog and take the long way home. You deserve it!
max bootstrap	The UN and their "research groups" (most of which are actually "advocacy groups") are total liars.  AGW is pure political contrived fiction.  As for "being worse than we thought"... you really do need to remember to go back and review your own predictions, including "half of San Francisco will be under water by 2013".  Hmmm, let me see, is it really worse than that?  Duh...  I've checked coasts where I have lived, and the water level has not changed enough for me to see any difference.  AGW is pure political fraud to justify globalism, funded by "carbon taxes" or similar.  AGW was chosen as the central propaganda of the globalists precisely because AGW would be a "global problem" that requires a "global solution" == "global government".  You guys are *suckers!!!*  BTW, you are correct that most large corporations and all governments are enormously if not entirely corrupt, and you address some of their atrocities in other videos.  I suggest you stick to those other issues, because this AGW hysteria just takes time away from important issues... like "exterminate Monsanto" and eliminate all patents on DNA and food processes... and hundreds of other *REAL* atrocities.
Muad Dib	Maybe it will be a good thing long term, forcing us to: - get the hell off this planet and continue our destiny as explorers. - rebuild more efficiently and learn to live in more harmony with our current planet It always takes a disaster to change things.

redwolf7227	Beware of computer simulated problems whose cure is worse then the disease it purports to predict.  My hat off to all you communists who have finally found a really scary way to get what you want politically, socially and economically without firing a shot.  None of the computer models have been right in predicting any of the detailed results of the current natural climate change we are experiencing.  Yes the climate is changing and the results are going to be catastrophic for some...but the solution is not to destroy capitalism or turn over control of our lives to global governance.  We have to adapt to the changes in the sun etc that is going to cause the global craziness in the climate that is coming...cold as well as heat.  But the answer is not socialism and the destruction of the capitalist system that has given us the wealth and prosperity we here in the west have enjoyed since my grandfather’s day.  Don’t throw the baby out with the bath water ppl...adapt and live with  underground grow operations, solar etc...but don’t tell me the magic gas CO2 (plant food) is the beginning and ending of all things ...the grand solar minimum is here...coupled with our general pollution and love of coastal living a lot of us are going to die...but it has everything to do with how stupidly we organize our lives and lack self sufficiency... not weather or not we own stock and drive SUVs or breath out CO2. 😋  https://youtu.be/-6gPF8r5XC8
stirtheimagination88	Capitalism destroyed Venus.
zero cool	i love how all these climate change deniers comments are from people that seem to know more than 99% of scientists and totally ignore ALL the FACTS.  Regarding all these comments about the elite wanting you to believe this, the facts point the the complete opposite, with the right and rich pushing agendas motivated by money and lobbying against any positive climate related changes.  Look no further than Trump, the biggest climate change denier who does the bidding of the elite.  When questioned he can't actually produce any evidence to disprove, and merely states its a conspiracy, hahahaha.  I can't wait until they make documentaries about how a rich guy from TV tricked the US into electing him after telling them he would lie to them because they're stupid enough to believe it and vote for him.  The anti-establishment vote for trump which turned out to be more establishment than any before, dare i say worse than hillary clinton who is one the most vile human beings of all time.

She cited, with lots of stunted and incoherent verbiage, some documentary whose director she couldn't remember, except to say several times that he was a 'photographer'. These issues are too important to leave to ineffectual spokespeople like her, who can't seem to string a coherent thought together.

Tell people to boycott corporations, and they plan for the next sale to buy crap they do not need. Humans brought this upon themselves. WalMart and Mcdonalds will still continue to be packed with consumerist assholes, that do not even think about climate catastrophe.
racewiththefalcons1	Remember, kids: next election we MUST vote for the hawkish warmonger even though the US military is the world's biggest polluter, and if that candidate toured the world to promote fracking, even better. Gotta vote for that person now so we can do better next time.   Folks, there is no next time. Next time is right now. If the democrats run a terrible warmongering corporatist owned by fossil fuels, they will absolutely, positively lose.
Gary Snider	Come on man.  No proof of co2 effects climate change. Not enough of co2 in the atmosphere to change anything. Basic science ppl!! The sun controls are weather.

rick	your apokolypse myth is a lie
Aaron Primack	The weather is not exponentially worste because of human caused climate change, its because god is mad at us for abortion, and the gays...
Vyth Riel	And I'm being told I'm crazy to be prepping
Judd Hurst	And just think about this they don't even take fukushima-daiichi into consideration corium in environment melting into the ground flowing into the ocean heating the ocean perpetually non-stop is never going to stop. All of these scenarios in this report all hands on this magic number that they're basing off of historical levels of carbon in the atmosphere and temperature rise and all that huha. But the dinosaurs didn't make nuclear reactors and they didn't let those reactors melt down into environment. People are so fucking stupid I think that shit goes into the ocean in it dissolves or gets watered down. Nothing could be farther from the truth one thing radiation does is equalized it builds up a bio accumulates in everything working his way up the food chain creating hotspotsthe fact that the world came together and supported the Chernobyl accident which was a 3% meltdown of one reactor that is 1/12 the size of the reactors in Fukushima which were full-blown meltdowns corium escaping into environment and it doesn't even make the fucking news that should tell you everything you need to know there's a reason these billionaires are building these bunkers that'll last for seven generations to 10 Generations the media says oh they're doing it because they're scared The Peasants are going to rise up with their pitchforks and steal their gold that is not why they're building these bunkers you would never have to go underground for seven generations to escape an angry horde of peasants. People better wake the fuck up
George Seefoo	Why do people believe without investigation. Don’t just go with what the bought experts say. All your basing your information on is pictures of places you’ve never been to or will ever go to. They throw out numbers and there’s no way to validate them. Back in the 70’s they said the new ice age was coming. Pay attention to what their selling and you will see their agenda.
Ryan Curry	We need to stop obscuring the truth of the problem. This is not on individuals to make limited voluntary changes to their lifestyles. The only reason we are in this mess is because of global capitalism and its grim addiction to fossil fuels and meat agriculture, and the only thing that can possibly hope to avert the resulting catastrophic global extinction event is a socialist revolution in every developed country within the next half-century. Believing anything to the contrary is deluding yourself at the cost of life on Earth as we know it.

G Kuljian	We're toast. Just live what you've got left and enjoy it. We can't stop emitting carbon or we jump 3C immediately due to loss of global dimming. Damned if we do; Damned if we don't. At least all those  decades of being upset about this wasn't in vain.

WTFU TV	I've watched pro and con on this issue and I haven't made up my mind. The carbon taxes are just a way to control us through energy. The better solution is for everybody to quit raising cows which causes over half of the methane and carbon dioxide pollution. Going vegetarian would help the planet rebuild itself from the oceans to the lands. Then again this climate change might be a natural phenomena due to our solar system and things beyond our control.

Jaen Martens	Pretty soon the factory farming and animal mass killing will prevent our crops from surviving and everybody starves. We already see crop failures of grains and other perfectly sufficient foods for all.
Jesse Daly	I’m sorry but it’s both, the creation of dead zones from fertilizer, deforestation, and animal consumption are super bad and do contribute to the problem, but even if that were gone tomorrow the 80+tw we consume in fossil fuels will get us killed and the only technology that can hope to replace that is liquid salt nuclear. But we should have started rolling that out 40 years ago. Even if we had a complete revolution, and implemented all of the above I doubt we would have time, the arctic ice is going to be permanently gone year round in no more than 15-20 years, possibly sooner.
J P	HEMP!!! Everyone should be required to grow hemp.  Hemp absorbs 4x the amount of co2 than trees and is a renewable source for textiles, energy, food, etc.   and it smells good!  HEMP!!!

Walrus Trent	The biggest the lie, the easier people swallow it. Plus telling you about impending doom makes you incapable of rational thought.  Which is why most scams are based either on fear when they are not based on greed.  Jimmy get you critical thinking sh*t together and try for once to make arguments on both sides. Of course fossil fuels industries cronies will downplay or deny any negative impact of carbon dioxyde if it is real. BUT likewise the IPCC is currently draining billions to support its work and they certainly do not want to say right now that they were wrong in the case they are.  Both sides are biased and self-interested. Plus the government has a vested interest in climate change being caused by human activity because then it's taxable.  The scenario presented is based on a model that has failed time and again to predict upcoming climate trends. This is not science.

J C	Nobody involved in the Paris agreement has any control over the planets climate. The UN is a ridiculous source of information. Theyre a political organization. The planets sea levels are 400 feet higher than they were at he height of the last ice age. Sea levels have never stayed the same. Don't be so gullible.
KironVB	Whats with all the climate change deniers in the comments, I've talked to Climate Scientists, they're fucking terrified, also the Summary of the report is not written by scientists but lobbyists and politicians and actually downplays the report itself written by scientists, the report itself is actually far more terrifying than the summary that the media and politicians focus on.

It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).  “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions."  "The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife."  Time to go vegan HowToGoVegan.org

theREALmurtibing	Fortunately for us the world is warming slightly. Living in an interglacial period is as lucky as it  gets. The last ice age only ended as little as 12 thousand years ago. Where I am sitting was below an ice sheet up to 3 miles thick.
D W	Maybe its overpopulation of the Earth, our planet can only sustain so many people. Everyone on this thread has taken an airplane to some destination and I am sure everyone drives a car. We as a race are omnivores so we eat basically everything that grows, crawls, walks or fly's. Global warming is alarming but would be much less if there were less people on Earth its really that simple.
Samuel Swenson	Please do a show about Ranked Choice Voting, it is the antidote to the current broken Election system that keep the 2 major Parties in power.
Don Ready	Jimmy, I love your show but do some research. These are computer projections based on sketchy inputs. The climate data is very poor when you go back a hundred years. Virtually none for the oceans except the shipping lanes, almost zero for Antarctica. All the computer projections have been wrong. The sun is the major climate driver. It was warmer a 1000 years ago than now. Yes climate changes but the ice core records show temperatures up, then C02 up. Follow the money. All the insiders have made a fortune on ethanol (a farce), wind power and scare mongering. Stop pollution, stabilize the population and we will make it through. Remember, C02 is an essential plant nutrient in yield limiting supply. Plants like the higher levels.

A line that was copied by one of the mainstream news services when the UN report was released.
Awakened Mind	BS! Al Gore had tens of millions of people believing in this nonsense back in 2003, according to all the UN/NASA statistics back then the entire State of Florida should have been underwater by 2016. This is nonsense. Furthermore, I live in the eastern United States where temperatures have gone down slightly in the past decade, I know this because I personally track the weather. Do not believe fear-mongering statistical b*******.
Leroy boy	In the last 100 years the temp has gone up 0.9 degrees and half of that happened between 1918 and 1945.  During that time there was not enough man made CO2 according to current models to produce that rise.  The climate has not changed since 2009.  Climate scientists keep trying to change their models to account for the lack in the rise of temperatures.  Jimmy you are right on some things but you have been sucked in to this crappy science.

alastermyst	So if memory serves, Ben Shapiro did a similar video with the exact opposite view. Namely he said the recent science showed that climate change hasn't been as bad as claimed and that the newest predictions is that the degree change needed for a catastrophe was a few degrees higher than was being claimed previously.

martini1179	As a futurist, I'm not that worried about climate change. All the data shows that the cost of renewable energy is growing exponentially, not liniarly. Solar and wind are growing at almost the speed of Moore's law, the cost of solar is also dropping according to Swanson's law--again exponentially, and solar has reached price parity with fossil fuels in many parts of the world. While some warming will be inevitable, I think we can fairly easily meet the IPCC's best case scenario statistics.

Thank Me Later	The 97 % of literature study Obama pushed is totally a fake, a lie. All they did was change the meaning of AGW midstream in the study when they found out that only 0.04% of papers agree. They start out saying it's about the IPCC type of statement agreement that humans caused over half of recent warming but in the end the definition they used to get 97%  was only that humans cause some warming.  Look at their internal dialogue: "OK, so we've ruled out a definition on AGW being "any amount of human influence" or "more than 50% human influence" so we're going with Arni's porno approach... "

He studies past climate changes, the drilling out of the ice core that shows what the climate has been for the past 100,000+ years, and he calls himself a catastrophist by looking at the past and how it has shaped our planet. These are just a few things his studies out of many topics. This is his assessment of the climate change data.
thomasfholland	Kind of like the opposite of a nuclear winter! So maybe if we nuke ourselves the balance in the force will be restored. (Sarcasm)
13 WhiteKnights	Climate always change people....incredible how people still fall for this trap which is a scam created by the banksters...
socialiststeve6 Cotterill	"When filming a crime is a crime you are being ruled by criminals." Great point from Jimmy Dore. We live in gangster times, and this vicious thug capitalism is going to kill us all. What to do? We are way beyond voting this thing better. Something much more "direct" needed perhaps . . .
Karligula	As George Carlin said, the planet is fine, we are fucked. Pack your bags folks, we're going away.
Tamer M	This is why I'm not having any kids.
Martha Rowen	We *can* change our agriculture system, and we can change our eating patterns, we can, simply by stopping eating animals products, meat, fish, eggs and milk products, individually, each and every one of us. We can bypass the profit system, not depend on our corrupt political system, and put the animal agriculture industry out of business. This is the one thing we can do for the environment that *will* make a difference. It's already happening, the question is whether it's happening fast enough. If every one of us start eating a plant based diet today, and encourage our families and friends to do the same, we can speed up the process. #GoVegan
Tychoxi	But the owner class never had it better so it was totally worth it.
Heath Riley	On the up-side: Won't have to worry about Republicans or Corporate Democrats after that, just some cross between Deacon (Waterworld) and Immortan Joe (Fury Road) . . . So, better?  Probably.
Maineiach	Come on Jimmy.... give it up... there is no global warming.. (look up grand solar minimum) and all these numbers are based on  failed science.. i mean really the UN is a joke!!!
john kendall	Consciousness always lags behind reality, even when with science we can get ahead to some extent , and climate change is proving this to be true . The actual worst case scenario is now our human extinction by 2030 due to crops being unable to grow. We will have collectively starved to death. The release of methane hydrate from the Poles   is already taking place, and that is anywhere  upto 30 x a warming gas to that of Co2. However there can be no solution under capitalism , because it is an antagonistic system of nation states . Climate change is a revolutionary question , demanding revolutionary answers that unite world economy and organise it on rational grounds. The fundamentals of what is actually happening was clearly elucidated to by  Karl Marx https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/12/etnb-d22.html.
pjmoran42	Jimmy you're being a useful idiot here. Read the IPCC report directly, not these catastrophic reports. This is pure crap and is NOT likely.
sparkgap	I luv u Jimmy, but you are 100% wrong on this.  The truth is we’re actually entering a cooling period due to a reduction in sunspot activity which is also what’s behind the increased tropical cyclone activity as well as the increase in earthquake and volcanic activity.   The Rothschild funded theory of “man made global warming” is just that - it’s a theory, but one now on life support. The original CO2 greenhouse warming theory was popularized by Carl Sagan, but this theory when applied to Earth has been largely disproven.    But don’t take my word for it, do your own due diligence on Google scholar and you’ll see.  For example, during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), 56 million years ago, a huge natural spike in CO2 sent temperatures on Earth soaring—but life went on and the ocean remained intact.  Because “the original sin of man” doctrine from Christianity has lost its guilt inducing power over the masses, the elite had to remake this “control mechanism” in the modern era.  So they came up with this theory to bolster their new religion of “the State” known as globalism.  I’m totally against corporate pollution, needless production, and consumerism, but carbon taxing every human for simply breathing while filling the bankers’ pockets will not address these important problems and only make them worse by creating the illusion that we solving them when we are not.  You have a great show, but you lose credibility when you regurgitate Rothschild banker created talking points.  You are essentially committing idolatry, mistaking a theory for reality itself.
Jack Black	Back in the late '70s the CIA started the radio propagating of low energy waves into the atmosphere in order to raise global temperatures. This was with the help of military and NASA.   The plan was to melt the polar caps and raise the ocean levels by hundred feet in order to drown all the darkies because they don't know how to swim or own boats.  And they would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids and their pesky dog.   Now the CIA is just building more Planned Parenthood clinics and shipping more guns into chicago letting all the darkies commit their own genocide.
flyingfishnet	get real. the geoengineering programme has disguised the problem. this is going to accelerate fast. biosphere COLLAPSE. the elite want us dead. its the only way we can alter course.
Johnny Aingel	Sad isnt it and it seems no one is doing anything about it i mean in unity in mass there is more of us than them why be afraid you have nothing to lose but your life
Martin Moulton	Thanks, Jimmy. Your're right on time. There's a big #ClimateForumDC happening in the Nation's Capital this evening [ bit.ly/DCCFCC ]. Was it Chomsky or (Ron Paul) who noted that all this information as released under Trump when insider electeds have known about it for years (ie: under Obama) ?
Attic Rat	This sounds like bullshit....
Spear Shaker	Is that curly sue girl for real or is that a character?
Forrest Franks	Give it up with the bullshit already with your climate bullshit.

Rob Lwsn	fear mongers for carbon tax $$$
kuranda tv	... and here is the current scientific data (not to be considered if you want a good story) http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/UAH_LT_1979_thru_September_2018_v6.jpg
Arnieus	Yes we are ruled by criminals and the criminals in the UN want to stampede the peeps into global government and taxes. The UN is not a credible source for science. James Corbett has many videos explaining this. Search Youtube "corbett report climate". Here is a couple examples. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOyBfihjQvI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA8n9fm5fwE&frags=pl%2Cwn
James Rodgers	So basically fixing climate change will cost the economy a huge amount. A huge amount is significantly less than the value of the economy. But wait fixing climate change will solve unemployment and would involved a huge redistribution of wealth
Kerplunk	Youre bullshitting, Jimmy.  China and india See still unregulated, and just spewing the pollutants hat er arent. Seriously? You wanna play a global game of pollution Whack-a-mole?  Thats exactly what youre doing.
Cheiften	the US decreased emissions while other countries increased in the last year.
David Purcell	Right and Al Gore said NYC would be under water by now. Global Warming is such an obvious hoax so that they can implement a carbon tax and literally charge us for the air we breathe. Wake up Jimbo
Deep Thought	The feed back loop Jimmy.
ken hawkins	Not denying, but the U.N. is not trust worthy.
GeekByDay StudByNight	You tell those punk ass shills, Jimmy.
dmoriartyz	Hitler was an environmentalist and Trump is literally Hitler
KasirRham	Assuming these IPCC climate models are correct, it's already over. We've failed.
Kristyn Nye	Dont worry jimmy....they'll save us with geo-engineering 🙄😏
Kenneth Knoppik	It's pretty simple you can't deal with climate change until you deal with capitalism. Which is the cause. We have to overthrow capitalism before we tackle any of these issues. Because ultimately capitalism is the cause.
Petra Dollah	Many scientists that are not funded by the deep state say it’s a hoax. Why don’t we talk about “climate engineering”, eg chemttrails, HAARP, DEWs, DARPA, etc etc etc?
freddie finklestein	That lady is way off base as to what is causing global warming.  It is coal plants not lack of green plants are the cause.  I wish Rob were here. FYI environmentalist, you are going to have to plug nose and accept 4th gen nuclear as 95% of the solution. Solar panels are as green as your laptop.  Wind just blows, even when it doesn’t.
knowspin	Per Al Gore, I thought the end of the world had already happened. 100 years from now, this same climate BS will still be used for political purposes. Man didn’t create this earth, and man isn’t going to destroy it, Someone else already has dibs on that, but spread the fear anyway...😢
Commode Commander	We have already started the feedback loops. Jimmy I've told you this on numerous comments. Interview Dr. Paul Beckwith or Dr. Guy McPherson or checkout Faster Than Expected website. Oh yea I forgot, you never review your comments.
nrabinov	Please interview Guy McPherson. He says we have less than a decade before planet becomes uninhabitable.
Sly	I wanted to share this video but the woman who stumbled through just trying to remember the name of a documentary destroys the credibility of what should have been a very credible discussion.
c l	We need to just speed up climate destabilization so we can get this made in so many human ways toxic  life overwith.  I may have said a few stupid things in life like assholes that invest time and resources in netflix are worthy of breathing, but oh well, people like clint amy darin are the kings of peon
Zorro455	Why all the dislikes????
taylor taylor	We were suppose to be flooded and burned to death every ten years if you want to do something start a campaign that everyone needs to plant a tree. The planet goes through very tropical times like in the past it was 143 degrees then it goes through a ice age and it rotates back and forth. Plus lets work on things we can plant trees clean up water and so forth.
bipola telly	yeah..... the cooling climate is going to be terrible.... sadly CO2 has no effect on the climate... So we won't be able to warm the planet.... YOU FORKING IDIOT!
Andrew Wright	Research UN Agenda 21. Research Club Of Rome. it’s a big FUCKING LIE!!!!!!!

Norman Byler	Climate Change = Depopulation! Look at obama Admin dropping 200,000 bombs on innocent women & children Millions killed all in the name of CC & making money, Good Riddance John McCain!
JO MANGEEE	The 400 year period between the fourteenth and the eighteenth centuries is sometimes called the Little Ice Age. Contemporaries noted that the Baltic Sea froze over twice in the first decade of the 1300s. Temperatures in Europe fell enough to shorten the growing season, and the production of grain in Scandinavia dropped precipitously as a result. The Norse communities in Greenland could no longer be maintained and were abandoned by the end of the fifteenth century. Scientists argue that data indicate that we are currently in an interglacial period, and that North polar ice will again move south some time in the next 23,000 years.

PAGAN FIRE	Sorry Jimmy, those reports are horseshit. Please go here: https://suspicious0bservers.org/ https://www.youtube.com/user/Suspicious0bservers Climate is governed by the SUN, not what we do.
Jerry Pelletier	They have been crying like babies about the tipping point since 1971.....TOYAL nonsense!!
Wendy Simer	Show them the data Jimmy......who how where and when was the data collected. Who how when and where was the data analyzed? Who wrote the final draft of the IPCC?       Just a reminder none of the previous predictions have come true, and global warming should be GLOBAL.        Either Jimmy is lying or is just really stupid.
James Lindsay	If we want anything to change we need anarchy. We need to tear down this system in the West.
Kate Baldwin	Industrial agriculture is the problem, not meat-eating.
Nafiul Shelim	The biggest enemy to the environment are anti-nuclear greens, nuclear is the lowest carbon source of power, we need to increase global nuclear power to at least 25% if we have any chance to fight climate change
M Morrison	What really absolutley terrifies me about the flooding of low lying coastal areas is that currently, they are primarily the areas where nuclear power stations are located. Just the logistics of mothballing those along with the waste, and of course, the still highly glowing core(s). Phew! Gives me the willies! A side-note. Those preppers that think they'll ride it out. Hope u like your plush caverns. Your gonna be there for generations.
J Ellis	let's face it there's very little we can do about climate change. Climate change is going to happen and it's going to continue to happen. 12500 years ago the entire Northern Hemisphere was under ice. I got dibs on the ginger

Graham M	Ugh I almost forgot you were on the left. Smh.
badsherrey	omg..where do you get your research?  climate change is a hoax.  the weather is being geo-engineered.  you need to really stop spreading this false narrative.  do a little research.  check out the 'in truth by grace' on you tube...don't trust what the government is telling you,  prior to the trump administration.
Epicenter	Honestly don't care about animal experimental stuff, but agreed everywhere else.
robert clements	Literally non of this stuff will happen, the IPCC has been claiming this garbage for years because their funding is determined by alarming the public.   More carbon = more vegetation = more life .  Jimmy is a terrible resource for this information because he has no critical faculty of the report
Judy Silka	The ultra rich building under ground high tech condos. They're gonna take their money and go live like rats, rather than make changes to save the Earth.
Keith Bennett	I don't get people's problem. China are still creating new coal mines every week and have been for years.they said they will calm down their co2 production in 2030.why?
Suave sailor	Um... It's not as bad as you think the sun is at a minimum of output now. Up north we are getting colder weather earlier, snow earlier, snow has already landed in North Central part of the U.S earlier than years past. Snow in early October is ridiculous, snow used to land around later to the end of November. For the last four years, snow and cold have been earlier in date than ever. Last three years it's been so cold no fans or air conditioners had been needed. Ask a solar scientist they will tell you they are worried that this solar minimum will last longer and be at the edge of a mini ice age.
David Coker	The surface temperature has only gone up 9/10 of 1 degree in the last century.  The IPCC and all of their deceptive cohorts know they have based their predictions on the false premise that the upper atmosphere will heat up much more rapidly over the Tropics than it actually does.  Only the Russian model gets it right because it is based on fact and not speculation.  See for yourself and stop believing all the horse ship Dore pushes.  https://youtu.be/fA5sGtj7QKQ
Bob Spelledeitherway	first of all, global warming, climate change ? communism, terrorism ? what do those term have in common ? main stream media  fear porn. they cant call it pollution or controlled opposition. why, would they want you to know, or for you to question who, is polluting the planet, when they can blame you for using their products.  the earth goes though cycles which we have influence, nor control. if that were so, we must have caused the last ice age ??  call the polluters out, don’t use their terms, call it what it is.
wakaisgood	I believe in climate change but a question to all of you who believes in man made climate change. What percentage of climate change are we Humans responsible for? It can’t be 0 because we do have an impact yet it can’t be 100% because we aren’t Gods.   The reason why I want to know is that if our percentage impact is 10% then there’s nothing we can do no matter if we dump $600 billion to fix it . But if it’s 80% then solar and green energy can’t fix it . We need Nuclear power.
Rhymeaholik	The polar ice has already melted.
Joe Wayne	A inconvenient truth remember that movie by 2012 we will lose all the coast lines ......
654pedro123	You are being too pessimistic. We just need to nuke Yellowstone and cause a volcanic winter.
1walicki	Will anyone bring into the climate change conversation the reality of geoengineering ?!! Solar radiation management, particulate aerosol spraying, chemical ice nucleation, haarp ionosphere heating, microwave transmissions and other hurricane modification... in use today, at least 70 years old.. check the patents.
Truth Seeker	Replace your search engine with #Ecosia
The White Man	Fearmongering fake news.  I'm surprised that Jimmy actually believes this crap.  They've said the sky is falling before, and before that, and before that.  It never happens because the so-called climate scientists are lying.
Inisfad	Do you not understand that NOT ONE of the IPCC’s predictions has EVER come true?  Or that scientists who disagree with the anthropogenic climate change ‘science’ will NOT get funding or published????  Anthropogenic climate change is THE BIGGEST GLOBALIST HOAX that has ever been perpetrated on the world’s population.  FFS, even Christina Figueres admits that the purpose of the climate change platform is reduction of world population and redistribution of world wealth.  If you are truly concerned with climate change, forget this BS CO2 meme - science has already proven that CO2 FOLLOWS temp, and does not cause temp increase - worry about deforestation, etc.  The planet’s climate is driven by the sun, and the IPCC does NOT even put sun activity into their computer models.  Why is a progressive site actually abiding by globalist platforms??????
Chosen Two	The most important issue right now, thank you for covering this jimmy
Lucas Pompey	It's going to be Mad Max
DJ Walby	Jimmy please!!!!!!!! 'Climate Change' is horse shit.
Lusty Wench	Why tell me?  What am I supposed to do about it? Already have a house full of LEDs & don't use plastic bags or bottles.   If you expect me to give up bacon and rump steak, then let the whole thing burn. The elephant in the room is the never ending population growth.  Not my problem.
NAIVADA	Yes Jimmy, this has been pretty old f news, for over more than 4 decades now... When experts and scientists talk nowadays they no longer say that we "better reduce emissions" and stuff.. They say we better fundamentally restructure the economic system itself – which is the cause of the problem in the first place. But hey Market capitalism makes the world turn round so nice, right <3  OTOH, as long as humans can accumulate monetary wealth, there will always be greed and corruption, and life will suffer. $ad.  (Hi, great info! Love the show! Peace ;)
Salty Bear	Yea, and PETA just came out saying drinking milk is white supremacy... Not the most logical people.
Twisted Titan	If you idiots were alive 500 years ago  every natural disaster  you would also blame on climate change ( which you use to call global warming but the science didnt back it up)
burtosis	If you think the climate effects are bad, what do you think happens when a country with nuclear weapons goes from 110F at low humidity to 110F and high humidity with an outdoor survival time of 30 minutes?  When crops won't grow and animals die?  When a billion refugees start crossing every border there is?  It's going to be WWIII, possibly thermonuclear in nature and possibly cause the collapse of modern society.
zoeffirelli	Sorry Jimmy. I like you a lot, but in this case you fell for it. You‘re wrong. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JA8n9fm5fwE
Old Wisdom	Jimmy the world was 8 degrees warmer in the early 1300's before the 'little ice age'. The Northern agrarian societies were growing and thriving. Yes there will be hardship also there will be opportunity for new living areas and new food crops. Go North young man go North will be the new cry. Get ready Canada your sitting on prime property now.
Dawn Evans	Thanks for sharing this information!
Enon Emouse	Jimmy you should recognise that you are way out of your comfort zone. Humans have nothing to do with it. It is the ☀️. Check it out and do the research - Suspicious Observers, Electric Universe, Thunderbolts Project will give you a start. The math is perfect but the data is flawed, wrong or distorted to fit the narrative that human caused climate change = total change - natural causes. Not one study by mainstream science has considered the influence of the sun's weather on our climate. In fact, on many many occasion it has be found that data has been adjusted to account for the effects of extraordinary solo activity to give a cause for the observations Ask yourself, why is the Great Red Spot on Jupiter dissipating? Is that also human caused? It is also becoming evident that Venus' climate is experiencing change. There are even some articles discussing climate change being observed on every planet on our solar system. Look up on any sunny day and you'll quickly appreciate what controls everything not only on this planet but everywhere in this system. I see our understanding of the universe in the same way I see how we tend to understand a dog's behaviour; we anthropomorphise and ignore that fact the dog is not human. Dark matter, black holes, dark energy, pulsar that are 18miles across and x10000 the mass of our sun rotating on its own axis faster than a dentist drill, etc, etc. all in a vain attempt to explain the observations of an electric universe without considering electrical energy. Bullshit in is bullshit out. This is the 2nd time I've posted a comment on one of your vids on climate change and I again urge you to dig deeper on this one Jimmy. You want to be on the right side of this one. By far the most dominate green house gas is water vapour and its the suns activity or inactivity that controls the how much is present in our atmosphere.
Melvin Castillo	Climate carbon scam.  Can't believe how many people fall for this bullshit
Jeremy Barlow	Jimmy, as a lawyer, even with a good lawyer most of our laws are written in such a way that there is nothing we can do to help you once you have been charged. The trials are just for show 99% of the time. The vast majority of judges are chosen by the chamber of commerce so there damn sure isn’t anything that they are going to do to help you if you hurt a business.
OptimusMo	Climate change is real, but this article is from a source known as "The Intelligencer"? His source has zero credibility. You can't make a strong argument based on non credible evidence. There are plenty of articles published in credible science and academic journals that could and should have been used instead of this dumbass article.
Laine Gordon	i'm assuming few of us are scientists, so opinion and cut/paste will rule here but just for the convo - the climate appears to be in for big change not because of man's actions/inactions...rather it is the shifts in our magnetic  molten core that generates a mag field  (defends our planet against devastating solar radiation,  solar winds etc).  This magnetic field extends thousands of miles into space has supposedly weakened by 15 percent over the last 200 years.   btw historically, Earth’s North and South magnetic poles have supposedly flipped every 200,000 or 300,000 years...and the last flip was about 780,000 years ago, meaning we're overdue.  any actual science minds out there?     https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/earth-magnetic-field-flip-north-south-poles-science/?user.testname=lazyloading:1
John B.	I agree with all that except the bit about the climate.
Steve Hayes	Every single Climate Change prediction, for which the date has already passed, has been wrong. When this happens, genuine scientists do not just keep pushing their predictions into the future. Rather, they realise there is something wrong with their hypothesis and/or models.
Mike Cziraky	Man made climate change is hoax.  I’ve been hearing doomsday for decades
Ant Man	I know our last 15 predictions of world destruction have been wrong, but now the world will super explode, if we don't do something this time.
ivette moux	The planet is going through a natural cycle, it's happened before. The problem is the technology that is use by the crazy ones in government to manipulate the weather and make things worse. Yes, we have allowed the rape and destruction of natural resaources but, Humanity will disappear first before the planet is destroyed. George Carlin said it best, " we are bugs that the planet shakes  off" something to that effect. Climate Change = the Elite wanting more money from the serf. If the UN cared they would release the technology that ALREADY exists for free energy, that won't happen because the REAL parasites on the planet ( oil and gas corporations) won't allow it. The planet is going through a natural cycle.

Check out the Kalergi Plan 1924 , your scared of Global warming The Kalergi Plan will scare the shit out of you.
Mark Edwards	This is a much bigger problem than if we all go onto a plant based diet. And to try and sell that we must all become vegetarians, and it still will not solve the problem, is exactly why many people are turned off from activists. Have you ever seen the smoke and toxic plumes when you light a can of oil ? We are currently burning nearly one million gallons of oil per minute worldwide. We are currently burning nearly one million tonnes of coal every two seconds worldwide. Source :  http://www.poodwaddle.com/worldclock/env3/ We must fundamentally change our whole way of lives to repent. Not just change our diets. Our way of life must return to similar to one hundred years ago. Virtually no cars. Virtually no electricity except lighting. Locally produced food, no exotics. No central heating. No air conditioning. No air travel. No plastics. No TV or monitors. No smartphones. That is what it is going to take. It ain't gonna happen. And no government that comes anywhere close to suggesting these changes will ever get elected. It is a law of nature that everything must die. If you lead the healthiest life style that has ever been lived, you will die. Mortality has always been a hard concept for our species to accept though. Religion preys on it.
Jim Sherwood	The correct term is called Climate Collapse, not climate change. Telling us in the next century things will be bad is just pacification. We will be lucky if the biosphere holds together another decade.
Zohebali Khan	This is a consequence of having a Capitalistic-consumerist-materialist world view. And a toxic ideology of Infinite growth on a finite planet without the necessary moral constraints.
T. A Soligard	So Al Gore is rigth? ..and mankind can change the GLOBAl climate? Nope. Buy a boat.
Pierre Picard	How can you buy that BS of global warming? The climate change is cyclic, it was proven. The open intent is to reduce population to 1 billion. The plan is to cut the emissions by half by 2030. It will result in a society where each will be at war to survive against everybody else. You defend progressive values you say? Do you really believe they care about the 400.000.000 that would suffer (their claim) water scarcity if they are able to kill 6 billions? Do you think they joke about that?
DrainTheSwamp	Jimmy shove your climate change fear porn up your ass

Craig Durso	If you've ever noticed , the UN can't stand western culture at all , as far as they go , the west is the cause of every major fucking problem in the world ... thus , they can't  wait to destroy it and continually tell us how bad we are , just look at Europe and see whats happening... they want us to believe that overpopulation and over consumption are the problems , that the masses are the reason we have no control ... they want you to believe your the problem and not greed or dominance ... RESIST
hypebott	You're so close to figuring it out Jimmy.  Why don't the Democrats just run on populist ideas that help the mass of people?  Because they've already written us off.  We're already dead to them.  That's why they don't care about schools, or medical care, or infrastructure.  It's why presumably right-minded people who should and do know better, like Barack Obama, Chris Hayes, etc are willing to sell out for these huge sums of money.  No one needs $30,000 a day to live, unless we're talking about living through an extinction event.  Rapid climate change from methane release is going to wipe out 99% of the population, and we are the 99%.
Gloucon X	Regardless of what happens with the climate, we need to adopt a wide range of Earth-friendly practices for the simple reason that it would make us better and happier people compared to the current system of brutal destructive competitive plutocratic capitalism.

MrBrokenazs	We need practical solution that involve empowering humans. We cannot allow the UN to make energy credits or a carbon tax.   https://youtu.be/0wlNey9t7hQ  We need to design a solution that creates wealth and power for the humans of Earth, not the elite bankers or Oligarchs

StealieSteve	Stop climate change? The MSM will question: but how are we going to pay for that? 🌻
Gman 5250	I was hoping to hear a cohesive conversation on "Climate Change". You fail to mention Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, which is a massive contributor to greenhouse effect, and you don't ever....ever....mention Fukushima. Ocean bio mass die offs??? What is your position on Fukushima? In Japan it is illegal to report on Fukushima, but they are building the Olympic Complex directly adjacent to millions of tons of lethally radioactive soil.   The northern hemisphere is in collapse, but not for the reasons the Progressives cling to like a religion, calling dissenters..."Climate Deniers". IPCC is massively biased and thoroughly exposed for producing faked/flawed models and data.  R. K. Pachauri was completely conflicted, and made millions through Tata Steel. His connections to the "Blood and Gore" Chicago Climate Exchange are well documented. Progressives and the left simply ignore the huge conflicts of interest, along with any other data that disagrees with their position.   You don't cite an ounce of real science to support your thesis, and you fail to acknowledge the complete body of science available on this subject. This is why I can't take Progressives seriously, you continually use emotionally charged talking points, but ignore the elephants in the room and promote...well, what do you promote sir? If you are going to expose geo-engineering, weather weaponization and nuclear contamination there is an abundance of real data available. The weather feed back loop is indeed very real, but not resulting from the data promoted by IPCC, who by the way, even lied about the number or scientists who agreed to their studies.   If and when Progressives begin to offer actual debate, rather than pre-packaged talking points, independents like myself may....may...begin to look at you seriously. Until then it's the same continual rhetoric, hyperbolae and Media Matters talking points. IMO
Greg Gupton	Why does Jimmy ask a question like he's talking to someone, but then it's just silent for a minute?
Ricky Rick	Climate genocide? I cant wait to see tree hugging, self human hating fuckbags die.

Between the industrial pollution ....mega Corps poisoning everything. lol and they blame the common person... #gofucyourself ... We're already in the 6th extinction.... #fukoshimooooooo its begun! The people have been so dumbed down that there incapable of this comprehensive reality. ...Me well I don't get enough fluoride in my diet.
R H	Man, I just woke up and I thought this was a really nice anime pool. But then I saw it was Dore and about climate change, and I was like “oh.” :/
Tomas Augustinovic	So yeah... we're f*cked. We had a good run. Hopefully the next human-like species will do better.
Carlos Belo	That statement at 8:00 is why i believe it's already too late. We aren't willing to do little changes let alone big changes. The time to change was 20 years ago, now it's too late to start.  Not saying that we shouldn't, but be real. Problems are only solvable when you face them.
Hello World	We're fucked.
Kari Mosleh	Lemme guess... dislikes include people that can handle the truth that their dietary habits are screwing everyone on the planet.
petite prince	to all the rightwinger here who dislike this video because they think it's a big hoax so the government can tax your emissions and control you more: solar panels are already cheaper than coal and in 10 years they will be so cheap everyone in a sunny state will have them and more and more people will drive electric cars too, wouldnt this be the scenario that the government and big oil, gas and electricity companies hate because then you produce your own elecricity and they cant make profit out of you or control you and turn your juice off
The Killjoy	Look up Tony Heller and 1000Folly, among other channels for a different opinion.  This Jimmy Dore episode is utter misinformation.
joesaiditstrue	how many species have been wiped out from human beings in the last 500 years alone, the planet can't go through that kind of durastic change in that short amount of time without some sort of reaction happening
True Lies	For millenia climates been changing. Sahara desert used to be a sea. Cold places will heat up and hot places will cool down its a natural phenomena. Thats why animals used to migrate and some adjust to the climate. While humans keep on preventing climate change  which is impossible and dont want to adjust to the changing climate. I guess animals will survive and humans will perish.. climate advocates use the climate nowadays to scare people and donate money for the benifit of the advvocates it because its their job. Antartica will melt but other places will freeze again. Its just moving.
Loki Hammerfall	@The Jimmy Dore Show Please Jimmy invite Dr. Steven Greer to your show...His agenda is directly related to this problem. It will blow peoples' minds.!!!
NGT	Last time we had a global emergency it was a scam (H1N1 fake  pandemic alarm)
daveruda	Capitalism baby! Keep going like we have been and nothing changes:)))
Jesus Elizondo	I'm not at all for the big oil companies, they destroy our planet but, the UN says? You mean the technocrats that control everything say "more taxes or we die?". Just to let you know most scientists just go by a few reports that are flawed. The IPCC has consistently changed data that doesn't fit their narrative, like the 18-year low, for one.  The same people that environmentaly destroy our planet are the same ones pushing climate change, think about that.  These scientists never mention the solar cycles, solar system, our our own weakening magnetosphere when calculating weather systems.   The government has been manipulating the weather since the 40s. Look up Project Cirrus, a joint collaboration between GE and the military, a hurricane was seeded and changed direction, headed towards Savanah Georgia, and caused havoc. This was again in the 40s, imagine what they can do today. The only reason the lawsuit didnt go through was because they found evidence that one hurricane took a similar path in the early 1900s so they took the blame off human intervention, but we know they will say whatever to keep blame off of them.
Petra Kann	The important thing to note from any IPCC report is that the predictions are always conservative in order to get so many scientists and nations to sign off the report before publication. So if the IPCC say the situation is grave then it's most likely far worse in reality. Also, the rate of warming of the planet is NOT linear - it is accelerating with time. We may have triggered some known and unknown tipping points earlier than expected.  The rate of warming (2010) is at least tens times higher than the rate of warming that ends typical ice ages. And the ice core data dates back to 800,000 years ago.  If you're not worried about yourself, then perhaps you should be concerned about the future our children will inherit

Frank Tee	Do you really believe this report..??..I believe in climate change but I don't believe that the human energy consumption is creating it.!!.I accept that we contributing to the pollution of the atmosphere to some extent but the  main reason for all climate chaos we are experiencing right now is the natural cycle of the solar system and our galaxy.!!!..In theory has been proven that the earth has been trough ice age many times before and with the same time gaps between them approximately..!!!.If anything will happen is not going to be rising temperature but exactly opposite    .This is my personal view giving the 62 years living on this planet and observing the changes and anomalies in the weather around the world..!!!!!
ultimateguitarwizard	The State is the new religion. Pay attention to these dire predictions, when they again, don't come true, you might start to see that this is about control. It's a call for one world government and the demoralization of advanced countries is a nice little side effect.

mis'l'anius 1	If anyone believes this nonsense take the time to look at the Greenland ice core sample data that was taken over a 5yr period in the 90's and then took another 20yrs to analyze.When you see the temperature at present then go back to 10,000 yrs you can see that it is actually has been oscillating up and down constantly and we are cooler now.The freaky thing is what happened about 11,500 - 13,000 yrs ago when we had massive changes in temperature of about 12-14 degrees centigrade which bought us out of the ice age.Now that's what you call Climate change!
BatMashUps	“Pack your shit folks, we’re going away!”
Tom Cieszenski	The thing that irks me the most about the left is you guys seem to think that the solution to everything has to come from government. If climate change bothers you, do like I do. Plant some frigging trees every year.
Pisstrooper pan shaker	Jimmy I'm not with you on this one,I remember the fear of global freezing in the 70 s, and Al  ( the con man ) Gore with his fear porn " by the year 2010 some % of the world will be under water.gtfoh there is an agenda behind all this . Don't bother commenting on this cause I don't give a f about your opinion.
Cody Clark	Farm factory produces some 30% of global pollution. The methane levels are off the chart and gigantic amounts of fecal waste runs into our clean water systems that then become undrinkable. It's fucking disgusting! Hey Merica, eat a fucking salad! Oh wait you can't because your lettuce is covered in cow shit.
Bill Trombley	Right the Paris accord and Kyoto and, blah,blah blah accord will keep the climate under certain temperatures...... when ONE prediction comes to fruition, post it and then we might listen, until then, know that this planet will be off of fossil fuel and farming live animals for food............ what will the UNs stand and reasoning be then? Jimmy cover 911 ..... it'll bring you more credibility than this schlock
Harvey Schaapman	The Paris Climate Agreement allowed China and India and others to be excused from any of the global warming requirements for up-to twenty years. While the USA was required to fulfill all the new rules, including pay for most of the funding to support the agreement. Thank God Trump had the sense to say NO!   If you understood the ALL facts you'd realize Trump offered to sign the Climate Agreement, IF, all the other counties were required to obey the same set of rules as the USA was required to do. Especially China and India, who have nearly half the world's population poluting this planet. Plus he wanted them to pay their fair-share, they all said NO, so Trump said GOODBY!    The more I listen to you the more I realize you're like a half-baked apple, trying to pass yourself off as a fully baked apple pie. You're pathetic, please GET INFORMED! Stop being sooo stupid!
Alan Simpson	Watch this for a different perspective. This whole thing has become like a religion and is way too politicised. People who have something to say should be listened to and not just ignored because their view on it has become politically incorrect. There are heaps of very well qualified scientists out there who are saying that carbon dioxide is not what causes heating but is in fact the other way around. The one thing that everyone ignores consistently is the effect that the big old sun up there has on the entire solar system not only our planet.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYhCQv5tNsQ
Glenn Swart	I love your show Jimmy and you mean well, but as someone who wasted 15 years banging on about global warming (me) I ultimately (painfully) had to concede I was mistaken after long standing heated debates with scientist friends of mine. Turns out climate change is a globalist strategy part of four methods controlling the global energy policies from supranational EU style sovereignty destroying institutes, and internationalizing carbon taxes etc. Contact me if you want more info. We need to forget the red herring and focus on pollution, fracking, solvents, mercury, lead etc and not plant food CO2 which is at historically low levels a quarter of of the lush, tropical flourishing plant eras like the Jurassic. Cretaceous etc. We are experiencing desertification because of low CO2
Willard Branson	Within that time I will be worm dirt, so it does not concern me.
Deisel 1968	Check out potholer 54 channel on climate change he debunks climate change deniers using published papers by actual climate scientists.
John Klett	Actually the Financial Elites are worried about the Ice Age which is overdue. Ice Ages happen every 11,500 years like clockwork going back hundreds of millions of years. Global Warming is caused by the Sun and the entire solar system is warming due to charged particles from the Sun striking the core of the planet which is heating the earth from the inside out just like on Jupiter, Mars, etc. What started this whole "man made warming fraud" was the Nuclear Power Industry needed to infliuence public opinion against fossil fuels so they promoted the alternatives. But nukes were their goal. Then the Financial Interests took over science funding through the US Government and came up with "Carbon" as the culprit to implement a global taxing strategy scheme. The PR behind the current effort is for the "Goldman Sachs Global Carbon Credit Exchange" which was to be signed into international law at Oslo by Obama but real scientists rebelled against it and so they backed off. Meanwhile the real deal trigger point, the achilles heel of the entire global weather system, is the Gulfstream Current in the Atlantic Ocean. When the Gufstream shuts down Ice Ages begin. The reason the Gulfstream current shuts down is when excess fresh water runoff from Greenland and the St Lawrence Seaway enters the Atlanitc ocean it dilutes the salt content in the water. There is a massive underwater water fall from the warm salty southern waters hitting the lighter polar waters located in the North Atlantic and this engine powers every major ocean current in the world and when it dies Ice Ages begin in as little as 20 years. The last Ice Age created 5000 foot Glaciers covering the US to as far south as Texas. That is a big problem for the Elites because 80% of all economic output is generated in the higher latitudes of the Northen Hemisphere. The funny thing is the Elite Financial Interests when they started this human caused global warming Carbon Fraud never imagined that Ice Ages could start so quickly. They had planned this fraud all the way back in the 1970's to the 1990's and at that time they selected carbon as the culprit for a Globalist Agenda to tax every man, woman, child and corporation on the planet. So if you had a small carbon footprint you could sell your credits on the exchange. But Wood's Hole Oceanographic discovered in the late 90's through deep sea core samples that once the Gulfstream slowed Ice Ages begin in as little as 20 years. Meanwhile they Chemtrail spray the atmosphere to cool it down by 1% by reflecting incoming sunlight back into space but let me tell you, the horse has left the barn, and they know it. They are still spraying Chemtrails for weather modification and weaponized applications but here is the deal, if you are speaking of carbom as being a pollutant you have not done the research and are hopelessly ignorant of the truth. FYI crop yeilds and native plant growth is shattering all records because of the increased C02 levels because when carbon mixes with water you get sugar and that is plant food. We are experiencing an abundance of plant growth due to increased levels of C02 even as modest as it is but this is not the cause of planetary warming noor is it a threat since C02's make up less than .04% of all greehouse gases! Say what you want and with all due respect the Left have not done even the slightest bit of research into this mass mind controlled topic and arre simply regurgitating the talking points of the Financial Interests, which by the way is the war machine, the Wall Street parasites that live off of human misery, war, famine and disease.  C02 makes up 0.04 percent The Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other gases, including about 0.04 percent carbon dioxide. And yes, Earth's CO2 concentration stood at 400 parts per million in May 2015.
the81kid	Nobody will ever protest for less. Nobody will ever protest to have less tomorrow than today. Nobody will do anything. But everyone will make excuses and blame their favorite scapegoat. The right will blame cultural marxists and Chinese/globalist/liberal/leftist conspiracy theories. The left will blame the oil companies (without which this standard of living would not be possible - and nobody is willing to admit this), Ralph Nader or Susand Sarandon, and conservatives. While everyone contributes to the destruction of the ecosystem. Tell someone that stopping ecosystem destruction means giving up their smartphone... forever. Yes, nobody will have smartphones again. They'll immediately turn off, or return to their technological utopia religion (tech will save us!). Virtually nobody cares.
John Johnson	Go vegan.   Yeah come at me haters.
Daltron 31	I'm so sick of all this fear mongering. I have been hearing this dumb ass shit my whole life. The funny thing is where I live it's been getting greener. Pollution and co2 are two different things. Plants need co2 to produce oxygen. It's a yeng and yang that you can not control it's nature
jmichealsmith99	This isn't possible.  Alien intervention is all we got left.
Joel Ferguson	I agree that deforestation for factory farming is damaging, personally though, I think we should take 10% of our bloated military budget and use it to build water desalinization facilities around the world.  Ocean water coming inland can be used for civic systems and new agriculture development.  With strict standard's against polluting in water sources, the water returned to the ocean should still be cleaner than it was at collection.
Denes CL Lopes	The solution is get rid of 5 billions people, and it is definitely not going to happen. Thanos is not real.
Craig Sips	I believe in climate change because the weather here in Scotland is getting warmer and warmer every year for the past 15 years.... but I don't hate or fear climate change, I am loving the hot summers and mild winters.  Sorry.
fujigerry	Which is why all the fuss over Trump withdrawing from the Paris agreement was so much hot air and another example of how fraudulent Obama was. Paris was a great example of how the biggest problem facing the planet could be kicked down the road while allowing corporate backed politicians to present themselves as enlightened and progressive. One can only wonder what sort of agreement could have been reached if people confronted Obama, Merkel and Macron with the same hostility as they have Trump.
Popart 2015	WW3 will make it even worse...
ChrisRants33	They've been siphoning money from folks for years. Global warming, Climate Change, blah blah blah. Don't fall for it. The Earth will resolve its issues regardless of human activity.
Magister R'yleth	My unqualified and unasked for advice is to live in a way that doesn't add to the problem more than neccessary in the name of getting to shed blame, and not dwell on it. If you've done what you can do as an individual, that's all that can be done. If things still go tits-up, like really bad, I advise you keep a gun with enough bullets for you and your loved ones.
Shah Suri	We are all so screwed but Democrats and Republicans are more interested in bombing the poorest people in places like Afghanistan than taking action which would destroy their profits from the Arabs.
Smedley Butler	You said it jimmy. That’s not going to happen. Like Arctic ice free by 2013. Venus has no magnetosphere, that’s why it lost its water. Also it’s like 90+% CO2 not 0.04% like us, of which a small proportion is human emitted.
Joseph Coppini	The human is the only animal in the animal kingdom that destroys what keeps it alive. Then justifies it by claiming it’s intelligent.
Jy Byrd	IT'S THE SUN!
Orla Graham	Jimmy you need to talk to Dr Peter Wadhams and professor Paul beckwith , the ipcc report falls short big time.
Ragna Eyjadóttir	That is what short sighted greed does .. as well as wide spread apathy and people who just "are not interested in doing their share"  In the 80s - when the climate problem was first made public on a world wide stage .. governments and especially people could have averted it with relatively little effort. Changing their ways just a little bit .. (like abandoning air conditioners, driving less, building better isolated homes etc. ) but they did not. While today we like to blame politicians for it .. we have to be honest and acknowledge how little the past generation did. They did not change their ways either .. they were happy leaving a burned earth behind, happy in their ignorance.  Now, - changing the almost inevitable is 1000 times more expensive and takes so much more effort. Even if those who benefited from the pollution back then would invest all their earnings into averting climate change, it would not be enough. And the sad thing is that its not like this is a big surprise .. this outlook was given in utmost detail decades ago.   And to those who are young today .. what is your share to avert it? Do you live in sustainable homes, eat sustainable food and live eco friendly? if not, you are part of the problem, too.
Siri Erieott	It will happen like this...  One day, after another warm winter and another unbearable hot humid summer, utility failures and food shortages will become the norm. Persisting without end.  Shops become steadily emptied of the basics, then the luxuries, people become irrational, then violent, then killers. Food, electricity, gas, will just stop, then the fuel will run out. Then you realise there is no more police, no government, no healthcare, no live TV, no trustworthy news.  In the apocalypse, it’s recorded propaganda 24/7. Without pay, people will go rogue on mass. Disperse into the countryside. Heat, drought, flood, famine, conflict & disease will wreak havoc on all aspect of civil society. The ‘mad scramble’ of carbon capture & renewable energy monopoly is too little, too late to retain civilisation as you recognise it now, Man will survive in isolated pockets of survivable, defendable enclaves. I used to believe 2 billion might survive, leaving 8B dead. Now I believe barely two hundred million will survive world wide a hundred years from now. To be clear- that’s 10B early uncomfortable human deaths. Within a human lifetime... I’ve made my peace, have you?
Thomas Smith	Jimmy, I've just decided not to believe in it. I will buy a big truck and eat shitty food. I'll call NASA liars and start saying "libtard." I will waffle between "There's no proof" and "Well, China's not doing anything about it, so why should we?" which of course, are conflicting.
AJ	It's futile to discuss any type of "climate change" with a fanatic believer. All they do is repeat "official report" after "official report". They conveniently ignore that the planet has warmed and cooled many times in human history and ignore scientists who have real, verifiable proof that the sun has dramatic influence on our global climate. They believe that its beyond conceivable that scientists could have  ulterior motives or be influenced by monetary gains. You mock those that have faith or religion, but blindly follow scientists just like the religious zealots.  But you wont care about that, you'll just call me a denier and/or an ignorant simpleton.  They'll ignore the Monder Minimum that led to the Medieval Dark Ages and the black death. And the Medieval Warm Period that ushered in the Enlightenment and the Renaissance. They'll ignore massive volcanic eruptions that caused widespread crop failures all across the globe and dropped the global temperature by almost a full degree Celsius. i.e The Laki eruption of 1783 and Tambora eruption of 1815, which was coined "The Year without Summer".   Never mind the earth's climate is ever changing and influenced by more than just humans, like the solar system and more importantly our sun. You're all in with the scientists who's grant money relies on propagating the myth that carbon is a poison to this planet, the very material all living things are made of.
Twostones00	Blessed be the woman who is without child and who does not give suck during these terrible times.  We have committed suicide by over populating the earth beyond it's ability to sustain life.  Each person has a carbon footprint and is placing unreasonable demands on the Earth's rapidly disappearing resources.  Yet people show their cruel, selfish, insanity and continue to have children with no future who will almost certainly perish as of the result of catastrophic climate change.  If everyone faced and understood the terrible times we will face there would be a panic throughout the land.  Unfortunately we have a political party of fools who refuse reality.  They are the republican party.
OwlNation Legal	An ice free arctic 2019/2020 with a loss of latency heat cooling and albedo leads to abrupt, PERMANENT temperature spikes, crop losses, famine, death of most of the 7.6B alive today, and when skilled labor stops maintaining 1,600 nuclear facilities or abrupt sea level rise along with superstorms drowns them, extinction from radioactive ionizing gas, or loss of ozone driven by methane and sulphur dioxide emissions, UV radiation sterilizes Earth.
freemanjack msiradio	AWWWW SHAME there was me thinking that perhaps there were still just a handful of rational minds remaining within the us left wing enclave and that you were one of them, nearly un-subbed after your recent disgusting display of virtue signalling with that live show you put up but climate change fud??? really??? what percentage of the atmosphere is made up of CO2? ok now add to that the 'anthropomorphic climate change' human input AND YOU STILL HAVE FUCKALL CO2!!!! Loonie left used to at least be funny, now you are just a little sad, ho hum, un subbed, bye bye.
Judean People's Front	unexpectedly, global biomass is/has increased. Not mature forests but as ice caps and perma-frost is receeding, this "frozen" land is defrosting and biomass is growing.

Robert Conti	Jimmy is much better at things he understands. He’s just hysterically reading the news without examining their data. Climate change is a hoax.
Antman4656	Judging by the thumbs down on this video Seems like the profit making oil corporations are still paying pundits and lobbying Republicans to make some people still think it's not real and it's not man made.  The same kind of corporations that told people smoking was not bad for you.
Slew One	And I am a monster for saying that poor people shouldn't eat so much meat.   I was angry that Obama decided that we can use EBT in Restaurants, and the first restaurant that qualified was Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Who is going to KFC to eat something healthy or a vegetable.    Ohh we should force the rich to eat less meat.   They are 1% and how disproportionate are their consumption of meat is compared to the rest of us.   Their food actually probably produce less emission.    Corn fed Cows produce more methane.  ANd the masses try to claim you can't eat healthy on a budget, and I show them, and they all run.  We can eat more beans and rice and vegetable.   I go to supermarkets in poor area (granted I've seen prices in other cities, and Los Angeles is cheaper due to closer proximity to certain farms, and the nature of our market), but Beans , rice, onions cabbage and potatoes.  is cheap as heck.  the problem with the left is they don't understand economics.   Many conservative lack concern of the Environment.    Guess what, they are the same.   Money is based on limited resources.  If we let liberals have the way, they will rape and pillage the world.   Give them more money, more oil is used, and higher end food is consumed.    SO on liberal economics, it would make the environmental problems alot worse.   They talk about the environment and don't care how much pollution that Iphone created.   Instead of whining that they do not have material goods, they should enjoy life by doing stuff, like play sports.    it's cheap oppose to video games.    This is why I agree with some on the far left that the average liberal.   Some socialist understand that they need to live the life the state, and materialism, even by the poor is bad and that rich having more shouldn't affect our happiness.
utuber2357	Earth's ecosystem is self correcting. There are too many people on the planet and have been so for the last 100 years. Nature will fix that - it's a magnificent self-adapting system.

It should be the concern of the people and if the people cannot solve this then it is the people that suffer. So go plant a tree Jimmy or get a chemical engineering degree or just shut up about it.
dr sokrates	Jimmy, I really love your show and support it, but I haven't seen any scientific proof of menmade carbondioxide being the driving force of climate change, though I have been searching for years. If you can find any scientific evidence for this, show it to me and I will donate 250$ to your show without hesitation.  Many greetings and keep up the good work.

Gerald O'Brien	I live on the east coast, and we have not had a real autumn in years. In the past, the fall weather used to begin at the beginning of September. We now get the hot weather at least until the middle of October, and even after that we’ll have days when the temperature goes up into the 70s. Two years ago on Christmas people were walking around outside in their shorts. But the scary thing about it all is that with such a dramatic shift in the local climate, not one word of it is ever mentioned on the local weather reports. All we ever get is, “it’s going to be a beautiful sunny day tomorrow, high in the upper 70s.”
BeeFriendlyApiary	The American honeybee failure rate is now 50% due to a fatally compromised ecosystem that can no longer support pollinators...
Yt Commenter	Those who keep on denying that climate changes are caused by human activity should be the first to be grouped into concentration camps and deported to unlivable regions when the degrees go up.  They are literally human trashes that need to be gotten rid of.
Joaquim Coutinho	#Fakenews. Ice melting is like leafs falling in October. In medieval times like in 1250 world temperatures were much higher then today. From 1940 to 1975 world temperatures felt. In 2030 they will felt again. CO2 blamming is a great business for many people
rocker4577	Climate change or Global Warming? If the UN said so it must be true.
Stephanie Reid	Wake up. You’re not solving this problem by taxing the hell out of Americans. This is their solution.
NWBackcountry	The single biggest change an individual can make to help the environment is to go vegan. 35%-50% of all green house gases are caused by animal husbandry, as opposed to transportation causing 20% of green house gasses. If you call yourself an environmentalist, and you aren't vegan, you are not an environmentalist.
Johny Bravo	Bullshit
Sarah Weaver	To what extent does the missile launching contribute to climate change?  They blame feet for warming the planet when the elite are doing a much better job with their missiles, nuclear and chemical weapons and the rising death toll in countries they have destabilised and polluted along with pollution of their own country by their own making.
MIKExMASSACREx	Shocker. Biggest contributor to climate change is factory farming and deforestation. Basically feeding the huge population and footprint the human beings demand on this earth. We need to figure out a sustainable way to get our nutrients....
Brian E	So many opinions in here How about this FUKISHIMA thing no one covers
James alt	Can't believe you buy this as the best scenerio or you believe a variance of 2 degrees Celsius will cause catastrophe. We have large variance throughout time.  And I am not disputing climate change I am just not an extremist. These sorts of stances are used for money and control.
Forrest Hunter	The voter policing is also contributing to climate warming.
Darksnovia	The only way we'll save our planet if we put all of these capitalist to death along with every member of their families. Capitalism destroys everything it touches and unless it is destroyed the human race has no chance of survival.
POPPA SMURF	just for balance, why didn't you show some articles from climate scientist, nobel prize winning academics and others who disagree with these conclusions?  you just cherry picked the most hyperbolic articles to push an agenda.  i'm disappointed, jimmy, you're better than this.  sadly, i had to dislike, the first time i've done so to one of your vids in a very long time.
P.J. Lowry	The infrastructure needed will never happen... no country will honor anything, because corporations are too greedy. They can't even honor 2 degrees so the genocide is coming. Just get ready for it.

Robert Bennett	Love your activism Jimmy, but I think you need a balanced perspective on Climate Change. The IPCC Report is a political report, not a scientific paper. The UN is in support of the Carbon Tax Scam. I converted from the Carbon Greenhouse Theory to the Solar Minimum Theory. By far the greatest threat to humanity is nuclear fission and there is no way of knowing the full impact of the Fukushima Disaster with the ongoing cover-up. Fracking is an environmental disaster. War and regime change for the US Petro Dollar has inches us closer to WW3. Corporate environmental irresponsibility is destroying the soil, polluting water and land and deforestation for industrial farming is obscene. There is much that can and needs to be done for the health of our biosphere, but a Carbon Tax Scam will only enrich the top of the pyramid. ... I recommend Adapt 2030 to get an alternative viewpoint on the Climate Change and how we are being impacted by the ongoing change in weather patterns.

MirelaK75	The biggest “driver” of climate change is animal agriculture and  yet you won’t hear much about it in the media. And we can blame corporations as much as we want but in the end it all comes down to personal responsibility. We are voting with our wallets. What people pay for is what we get. If there is no demand for animal products there wouldn’t be animal agriculture.  Not to mention all the horrible suffering and injustice that those poor animals need to endure every single day just because of something so trivial as our taste buds. They are beautiful sentient beings who feel pain, fear, love,affection, happiness... and they all wanna live free just like humans do. #GoVegan

thescopedogable	Climate change is a complex problem on the one hand we have the entire scientific community on the other hand, we have uneducated conspiracy nuts and corrupt politicians... who am I to believe?
stangeriam	Consuming 'climate change' with the establishment narrative, as they are jamming it down our throat is beyond ridiculous. Yes, we are going through climate changes..yet throughout all of history, do we actually think the weather stays idle? Look around us! The Earth always goes through its cycles..naturally. Just as other planets within our Galaxy...they are currently also going through its changes.  That being said, IF the establishment and their masters in the Corporate and banking World would allow us to use free energy would all be well Climate wise? It is sickening to observe people continously fall for the jedi mind tricks ..'PROBLEM REACTION SOLUTION' of the establishment. The tavistock institute and Edward Bernays programs have succeeded in hood winking the masses.
Richard Thomas	And that is why it is bullshit when Republicans say doing anything to slow down the damage from climate change will cost jobs (and hurt the economy)..... How would completely rebuilding the entire energy infrastructure of the world cost jobs? If anything it is going to create millions and millions!
John Jewell	Three decades at most??  We're fucked. The first Earth Day was 48 years ago and we're still fucking up the planet like a virus. We are, as is said of cancer, "a really fucked up virus that kills its own host..."  smh

Nyurie Khosh	lol! that moron is fine with “variable” animal research when she is taking her birth control or hormone therapy.
Teo Wiz	care to explain how they got to these "estimates"?
Dennis King	Not true global warming cause is not carbon but 2.4 ghz mega cellular towers by the millions, open microwave transmitters now 5 ghz towers why northern hemisphere worst?
Peter Petrov	Eating no meat is actually very easy to get used to when there are so many other foods. We currently eat more meat than fn wolves do (and we are becoming more vicious than them). Even top predators can't catch a prey every day. Sometimes it's a blueberry day and even godless killing machines like bears are perfectly happy with that. A snake would be quite happy if today it swallowed an egg. We eat 10 chicken wings for lunch when our gastrointestinal system is perfectly suited for all kinds of food and none of it is trying to run away. An added bonus to becoming a vegetarian--mosquitos and flies lose interest in you!
Kathleen Lowy	this planet is doomed and most people don’t care

fuckrupert	Let us blindly believe the new priest cast, who have replaced the back garb with white lab coats. Unlike their religious predecessors, they are exclusively prophets of doom.

I AM WHO I AM	Climate Change is REAL and ABSOLUTE TRUTH as the CYCLES REPEAT, going from 100k year long GLACIAL ICE AGES to 10k year long temporary warm INTERGLACIAL.  During interglacial, it cycles from warm to cool, cool to warm.  During ICE AGES, there is NO WARMTH OR SUMMER, NO FOOD, NO HEAT, NO CROPS, NOTHING but Scavenging and Hunter Gatherers.  They lived in caves to stay warm from 4 seasons of winter, so will all of you soon.   MAN MADE WARMING OR MAN MADE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A LIE.    SUN CONTROLS THE CLIMATE, NOT MAN.  VOLCANOES, AND COMETS CAN WRECK THE CLIMATE TOO.    If the lying leaders say continued warming, they mean the cliff is coming, dropping into freezing winters with no summers.  They said no new taxes, lie.  They said you can keep your health insurance, lie.  They said they will be more transparent, lie.  They said they will not spy on Americans, lie.  They said they want peace, not war, lie.  Everything they say is a lie and the opposite of truth.
El Jake	All our animals should be grazing in pastures with trees. Herd animals reverse desertification and sequester carbon into the soil. If we reverse desert in places like California think of the benefit it could have for the atmosphere.
Gerrit Govaerts	it's  a lot worse than what the very conservative/optimistic IPPC report tells you : they are ignoring a lot of positive feedbacks with methane topping the list . We will easily sail by 1.5 C and it will take a miracle and a lot of money to stay under 2C .

James Smith	Climate change is bullshit. It's just a global tax & enslavement system. People who push this jive are enemies of humanity & freedom. Leftists are losers. 🖕
Morgan Pypher	they have been caught lying before, fudging numbers to fit the agenda, blaming CO2 for global warming, lying about arctic sea ice, polar bears, thawing of perma-frost, etc. all in effort to extort more wealth from the working class and poor. using models that are so flagrantly flawed, that few ever coincide. grand solar minimum much? yes there is climate change, but it is not getting warmer as they would have us "believe."  the energy of the sun is not used as an input for these models, except as a constant. the sun is waning and the repercussions will be felt for generations, despite how much CO2 is found in the atmosphere. jimmy you have just re-enforced a flawed policy and its too bad that so many will follow your lead and "believe" the lies from IPCC, UN, et al. do your own research people, grand solar minimum VS maximum.
jha1927	The guest, in this clip, isn’t helpful.
Felix de Villiers	I don't know what to think about the global warming, whether natural or man made. James Corbett has studied the subject thorougly and has shown how scientists are cheating in their diagrams.He knows that the top powers are paying large sums of money to the climate change people to encourage the fear for ulterior and financial reasons.I know that since I have been living in Verona the winters have become warmer, and if the ice caps are melting......Disasters with earth quakes and flooding have always happened but they seem worse now.
sooph1e	When the big water gets here, Florida will be the first to go. Thanks a lot Florida, you voted for Trump, have fun under the sea.
jackpotsearlytapes	Time to unsub. Your reporting on Syria is great but this is just agenda21 propaganda. There is only one constant on this earth and that is change. So climate change is nothing to worry about. Maybe not good for humanity but hey that’s life!

nash984954	Religion used to sacrifice animals for their gods, is science the new GOD that fronts research to further human life, while killing millions of innocent animals, at what point does this killing poisonous toxin kill this group of animals, when is too much too much that kills the animals, we simply gotta know, this is info for our database they say.
tusk fu	The planet was here long before we arrived, it will be here long after we are gone. Since it's doomsday and there's nothing for it, have a good time while you can? Or maybe, just maybe, the UN is manipulating us? Either way, we need to take better care of the planet. I like Allan Savory's regenerative farming (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI), your guest's reforestation and ocean healing, plus of course more responsible human emissions. Let's get that biomass back! Get rid of the deserts, replace with grasslands and forests. I don't know how to heal the oceans.
487shawn	I am absolutely sure seven billion people has had an effect on climate and there can be some effects that are going to be disasterous, but have to say do people understand under a thousand years ago Greenland had viking farms, Vineland (Newfoundland) grew grapes, climate induced man to leave Africa seventy thousand years ago and started the great migrations, there are real concerns but your worried about meat, China builds a coal generating plant every WEEK!, people are not going to starve themselves from protein , technology is on the horizon like electric cars, wind , solar , tides, etc. that will drastically change outcomes and yes we will change massively our electric grids if the money makes sense,for instance the combustion engine in cars has two decades at tops! also the independance, I see so many off grid homes in my area (rural) due to the independance issues, get off this vegan BS! People are NOT going to buy it!! and yes building below sea level and in deserts has concequences! I find it annoying that  people from California are raving about oil , yet the very existance of thier cities and infastructure to live in numbers and areas they should never have are directly because of Oil and Coal and they are the ones who are the loudest, MOVE!
Cory Smith	So this will take a worldwide effort from ALL countries!.. yeah we're fucked
Novem the Reasonable Gamer	A crisis manufactured by old people that will destroy the lives and potential of our grandchildren. It must be so easy to make decisions for everyone when the people making them are the only one who will never have to pay the price.
Headband Harvest	the UN and IPCC are oligarch criminals themselves, and criminals lie. 11,600 years ago pulse water 1b rose our ocean levels 400ft and ended the last ice age, there's much more than just Al's taxable carbon to worry about...

Maurice Francois	Most of the deforestation is from animal agriculture.
Ton Hettema	Dear Jimmy, what has upset you so? What has caused you to be alarmed like this and leave reason and factchecking behind? CO2 is not bad. CO2 is a very benign, vital, crucial substance for all life on this planet. It has been turned into a boogyman by shortsighted, manipulating profiteers, beginning with Al Gore. And why? Because it makes the general public believe the false story of reversed cause and result that has been made into the greatest scheme of the last 40 years to harvest most of the money out of the pockets of guilty-scared people all over the world into the pockets of those who invented this global warm(onger)ing. The ICCP has worked itself, like a religious sect, into a position of authority on the wings of the mainstreammedia caravans and climateconferences merely by making computer models designed to scare and threaten and cause guilt and armageddon visions in the general uninformed sheepgoats. Do you see how they make their predictions believable? By constantly 'seeding' the skies all over the world with the most toxic, pollution causing, cloudforming, substances. Sprayed from the specially designed tanks and nozzles of thousands of airoplanes that crisscross our skies day and night! Do more research, do more interviews with real experts, find out what is going on, follow the money, curb your alarm before you get yourself a heartattack.
declan h	This from the scientists who were pushing global cooling not so long ago, these people don't have a clue what's going to happen and are motivated by massive the grants they get for supporting climate change.
YepX	All for everything else but meat's so delicious. Still, money means nothing if we're all dead.
D Master	Paris was to keep well under 2 degrees and aim for 1.5. The latest ipcc report is still conservative. Even two degrees could produce positive feedbacks which could result in Runaway climate change.
Euro Bandit	Something really important people dont usually understand: When scientists make predictions, they are always on the conservative side. Always. Thats how science works. They want to avoid wild predictions, so they tend to exclude factors, that are vague or uncertain or unproven.   When we apply this to this report, people should understand that things are much much worse already. Right now, we are on a highway to literally destroying the planet and making it unlivable for humans, if not for most forms of life.

un known	IPCC Doing their job of Fear mongering great. If they were serious they would be calling for population control. 400k water scarcity? Population increase. Thousands dead because warm tempetures.. old people, wonder how many will not die of cold/homelessness. Flooding of major cities because of predicted "tipping point", this would be no submerging of cities. As if Icpp would be reliable in prediction of 100 years. Heres to more hysteria bs shoved down everyones throat and some more excuses for goverment bodies to distract and fuck the populace with.

Leah	Thank you guys for talking about animal agriculture as a leading cause of climate change. Hardly any environmentalist groups even seem to talk about it. Idk if they're that biased toward eating meat that they ignore it or what.. but the fact is that it's a very cruel and hugely destructive problem that totally isn't necessary.

It's all bullshit to try to get money.  It's a scam.  We need to rebuild the music industry and kill lady gaga and mondana and the rest of those shit ass pop musicians.  Also, those asshole hollywood dickheads.  You get rid of them and the temperature will go down to -546 degrees whizzleput.  The Martian Ghost are laughing their asses off and fucked up earthlings who thing there are 594 genders.  Ha Ha.  I got it. I think it is all overlooked because an asshole documentary kissing whales up the Amazon replanted forest.  Or something like that --- yah-- a bamboo photograper (h - fuck it).  Ducky Ducky Ducky Downer diet change.  The West is the best.  Gimme money NOW!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!! We should all wear Orange NOW!!!! that will make people thing we know our shit!!!!  I love the dinosaurs.
Steve McCormack	People always change when they have to. Not before. When the chatastrophe is felt there will be action.  Like when you have cities flooded and upheaval.  The correct way would be for people to analyse things and listen to the scientists but we are not in that type of society. Our civilization is based on Science. Our society is not.
Tumble Bug	Jimmy, stop knocking "meat" agriculture.  Growing veggies for vegans is what is causing this problem.  I don't care how organically one does it, agriculture destroys soil.  To sink the carbon, get the herbivores grazing again.  Stop growing domesticated plants!  Eating meat does not cause climate change.  Idiot capitalists do.
Kevin Rex	Start living it up now. Get it while the getting is good.
Nathan Halicki	Are they not going to justify depopulation because of this.   You can't control it due to population size and hyper development of 3rd world countries???
Peter M. Eggers	The environment has been rapidly being degraded by humans for decades.  Carbon in the atmosphere these days heavily impacted by humans, including those in the third world burning forests and grasslands which maybe more than those of the industrialized west.  The degradation and erosion of the soil is a much more serious issue than CO2 emissions, and contributes to the elevated level of CO2.  There needs to be a holistic approach to the environment, rather than tunnel vision on single issues.
1917 Mayan	A dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, democracy for the rich. The secondary contradictions  of environmentalism, racism etc... can only be solved through solving the primary contradiction which is Imperialism. Voting within a system that serves the interests of the imperialists and the comprador capitalists will never get anywhere and or anything done. Like trying to find equality in an unqual system. History has taught us that to combat these contradictions and to achieve unity is to uproot capitalism and to install socialism, a dictatorship of the proletariat through violent revolution. Any other way would not acknowledge the seriousness of what is at hand here and the ignoring of dialectical and historical materialism.

We know we r going to die like everybody else but we will die controlling the world system and after that we don't care. Our kids and grandkids will have enough money. They'll be fine." This is how they think. Deep down they know that money MIGHT NOT save their kids but they just dismiss the thought and keep moving- towards the destruction of mankind.
Phoenix Swooping	It's population, Jimmy. But Total Automation will make worker-consumer-voters obsolete and coercive fertility control will need to be implemented.
darren edwards	The grand solar minimum has begun. These temps won't play out rather we are entering a cooling period which is supported by the raw global data. Yes, we need to clean up our way of living and move to full renewable energy platforms. The IPCC have failed to produce a single accurate model that supports their assumptions and the last few years is no exception. People are switching off because the science is incomplete.

Jan Ski	Jimmy, you need to chill-out.  You're getting all hot under the collar.  Don't worry about the climate.  Change is a natural state.  Unlike the way the USA is pushing for WW3 with Iran, Russia and China.
Zurround100	I have a crush on Nellie Mckay. She is beautiful and intelligent and i love her voice.
Atalanta	This is why I just try to live it up. Fuck it all we all doomed let's enjoy while we can.
Travis Travinyle	I don't deny there are tons of "pollution" issues world wide by both governments and corporations. I don't deny that climate changes and goes through cycles. However the agenda and narrative of imposing taxes globally based on a world threat of human caused climate change go back to Tri Lateral white papers from the 70s.
TKK	So we're dead basically
Merit Ocrassie	Climate Change Scientists (zealots) predicted we were all going to die by 2015 ... cant get any worse than that.
Dave La Violette	I've known this since the late 1970s and people always call me out for not saying anything positive.   It's up to everyone now to change their lifestyles.  I have done all I can and I knew that bringing children into this world was criminal.  People expect governments or corporations to change - but it's only individuals that can make the changes necessary.  Basically you people are so fucked!
keith brinson	Excellent calm energy with heavy subject 👍🏽
Mitchell Porter	Manmade global warming (now known as anthropogenic climate change) is real but slow - the ocean is an enormous heat sink that has to warm up before the surface world will see the full effects. And if you ask me, some form of artificial superhuman intelligence will take over long before that happens (or some form of artificial life might wipe us out). Superhuman intelligence should be able to remake the world from the atoms up, so the values and agenda of the first such beings should be what really decides the future of Earth.
Reminiscable	2:46 5:32 FINALLY common sense!
Joe Sinkovic	It's to late. We may only have a few years at most according to Guy Mcpherson a guy who knows his onions.
Sean Sbragia	GOP owns our destruction now.
bob hope	Haven't we survived like 9 ice ages and the super mega ultra volcano erupting in indonesia? im as scared as everyone else about climate change but i think the scarier thing to think about is what happens to those who survive it.
Mark Buchholz	Try some scientific research of your own, 100 years, 0.9 degrees actually. The 31 reporting programs are fudged.
Alex Post	anti climate change science trolls in the comments hard, GO AWAY! SHOO!
FactFinder	Paris Accord didn't even include the Biggest "polluters", that seems like a bad plan. This gets hoaxier and hoaxier, how does melting Ice Caps cause Water "scarcity"? Let's go back to basic science to see what happens when you melt ice. But the Ice Caps aren't melting anyway we are actually entering an Ice Age, according to the Non-UN Scientists. oooh nellie...lol NPC Alert. There is a Green Explosion underway from the Co2, isn't that still the opposite of "Deforestation" or did they change that definition too? 2 Party System means you're going to die, 3 party system means everyone will live forever...but only if Ocasio-Cortez gets elected and all non-Centrist voices are removed from the internet. #FreeCollage4All LMAO...jimmy has officially become unlistenable...it was fun while it lasted.
David Emel	Fear porn. Carbon is not a pollutant. Ruralization, Albedo, Sargassum, and wars, are the only human contribution to global warming!
Joshua Jung	The Globalists have gotten to Jimmy! The Globalists have gotten to Jimmy!!
CrestOfArtorias	You know the worst of it? Even IF we manage to do all that, eventually the climate is going to change towards a hotter environment anyway. Because technically, we are still at the ending part of an ice age, which ended about 11 000 years ago. Let that sink in, most of the time our civilizations have existed, they existed in what effectively is an exception to the norm. Ice ages only make up 5% of the time our planet existed, meaning that the other 95% weren't ice ages. Which in turn means, the normal environment of Earth is actually much higher.  While we are accelerating the process, we would have reached this point in time anyway, well our species at least. So even IF we could slow it down, we would never, ever be able to stop it, even with the most radical reforms.
sirgay meerkat	So! we are all fucked! Too many people with their head down saying "nothing to see here!!"
Creaa Tiive	its called snuff...
riggermorpus	As long as the population keeps growing we're hooped.
Insectoid Clan	Vote Republican for midterm and keep America great
Micheal Young	Load of shit.
Thought Criminal	So climate genocide is the new term now? Typical! Also the Paris climate accord would have done nothing but give tax payer money away with no results! Also the ice caps have record growth.... this report is nothing but fear mongering from people who need people to be scared to stay funded and in power!
Protyus Games	Went vegan and lost a shit ton of weight. I can see my abs again at 55 and the meanwife has been giving me the look again.  The future is just a decision away.
Blake NoLast	Than fucking go vegan already! The NUMBER ONE way to combat climate change is to end animal agriculture, by going vegan.
SpectatingBystander	We're F'd in the highest degree!! Get ready for 1st Scenerio: The Purge Anarchy to cut down on human population. After that the 2nd faze will be Elysium as the ultra rich leave the broken planet to live in space as the 3rd is a Mad Max scenerio on the destroyed planet filled with all the poor to fight over scraps the rich drop down form their Ivory towers in space.
Cassie Stephenson	Im just here like. Yeah we cant stop this. Its too late.
Architectural Works	i super believe that the elites have somewhere else other than earth that they can live on once earth is fully damaged...moon or mars....which makes me wonder...why they didnt go back to the moon..actually the elites already have residentials there...just that they dont want the public to know...its just a theory but has sense to it....imagine this... the elites and us live on earth...together they know the destruction but dont seem to care....definitely they have some backup plan...when all hell breaks loose
THE JACK HQ	I just made a new friend in a vegan. One of the nicest people to have a conversation with. His Twitter name is Kaivana, if you want to check him out at @sryiwasclimbing. He is very educational when it comes to breaking down big agriculture.
Reko Sri	tonight when you tuck your kids/grandkids into bed tell them "goodnight" and also "I'm sorry"
kenneth osborne	We have been on a warming trend since the last ice age and that is a good thing because nothing grows in a frozen wasteland.
Robert Simon	This is another issue...open borders being the other...that I can't support progressives on.Al gore and a handful of others have gotten filthy rich off the global warming scare.Few others on here have already mentioned it,so I'll mention it again...these same experts 40 years ago were predicting another Ice Age.
hardikilus dopadikus	If you are so worried about it how about do something about it, instead of spreading the panic UN style start planting trees, everyone can do that.
Shan Ri Ha	Mans emissions are 0.000012% of Atmospheric Gases a year and the average temp over the last 30 years has risen 0.2 Degrees and this Nth Hemisphere Winter will break COLDEST records continually this year. I want pollution etc gone as much as anybody, remove all of it but that isn't going to change our future climate at all because we are heading into a Grand Solar Minimum and it's going to get Colder. Why has it been changed from Global Warming, why are they calling it climate change? Oh! that's right the climate is ALWAYS changing so they've got an out. Al Gore said our children wouldn't see snow after 2016 and that there'd be NO Ice at the Poles etc so what about last week when boats couldn't get supplies to Arctic outposts because of to much Ice. Crops are failing because of Cold not hot and it will get worse. That's my two bobs worth. Peace
Gedishka Entay	There is one thing left to do. Build the biggest a penis statue and have it painted gold with a caption that reads, "Idiot people brought the extermination of the human specie", in every language including in binary and electrical pulse.  It would make so much sense we would commit a genocide of the living things, after bringing humanity on the brink of destruction close so many times, with atomic bombs, it is a progression, of the worst kind.
nespith	The ipcc is still very conservative. They list in their report the Arctic isn't supposed to lose summer sea ice for another like 50 years but the actual climate scientist believe it could be within the next 1-2 years.
aubi faedra	Jimmy, please don't be such a dunce~ it is the sun that regulates climate change~ you are being made a fool of by fake science. This is a tax scam. Dont fall for it. Pollution is a real problem we must tackle tho.
Sam Chilcutt	Jimmy you are smarter than this! Stop believing this UN garbage. They just want our money. The Earth will be what it will be...
Chickenbeek	Never were guaranteed to last forever.
Hamwamaangezockt	Globalisation is the problem. And the mantra of limitless growth for a quick profit. Freight traffic is the number one polluter.
piasau49	Climate change is a scam.
kyle payton	I get more truth and information from two comedians and a singer than I do from our mainstream media in the USA.
moochy the cat	Dear Jimmy... Please explain to your subscribers how everything in America is now controlled by the Jewish Lobby.
Julia Crawford	The ice in the North Pole isn’t freezing as much as it should for the season because the waters around it are around 4 degrees Celsius warmer in some areas, which is a massive increase.  Less ice freezing, means there will be less to keep the currents from the north cold, which will disrupt weather patterns even more and cause even less ice to freeze for the next winter.  This is what I’d call a self-accelerating pattern of global warming that now doesn’t even need our help to get worse and worse.    Climate change is natural.  Dumping billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere isn’t.  We have accelerated climate change and now it’s taking off down an endless mountain without our help.  Now we have to find a way to reverse it, or earth simply won’t be hospitable for us without creating habitat bubbles.
Gun Reform	We need to take action soon! We must listen to the global climatologist and intellectuals like Al Gore. Don't the people realize that the polar caps will melt before 2014 and that date is encroaching fast?
Dallas Sucks	climate change is deliberately vague, it's called global warming.
Philipe Marchal	Fusion reactors could become a reality within the next couple of decades, there are people doing something about climate change even if it doesn't seem like it. I am hopeful about the future.  Check this article from the World Economic Forum on the subject: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/a-new-era-in-fusion-research-at-mit
Marina Tonkonogy	Glad to see so many Trump supporters watching Jimmy. At the same time, it's scary to see how many dumb asses, who deny science, are out there. We are all going to be wiped out from the face of earth in 20 years because of them...and they'd still deny it. Keep reporting on this Jimmy. If the idiots unsubscribe because of it the hell with them. This is something we need to talk about every day.
justice4germans	see James Corbett's vids on the subject if you want the truth
Jeff Blevins	lmao... climate change may have something to do with the mother fucking crazy scientist launching over 2 thousand nukes into the ionosphere. So why arent water levels rising?...what about all the shit they are spaying into the skys? and guess what every planet is warming ...is our carbon footprint effecting all the planets...and this is just fucking ridiculous. Was there climate change before the industrial revolution?...the answer is yes. Shut the fuck up, and if you want to wory about making change ...talk to China at around 1.4 billio.. The UN gave them free reign to pollute for 20 more years.  Get real...350 million vs 1.4 billion destroying the planet way more than us. But the UN says oh, thats fine  You get 20 more years of fucking hte planet? What about Fukashima...never hear a word about that abymore....hmmm...little odd.
Rocky Shorz	Fox news had an expert on today.  Director of Science Koch brothers owned and funded by school...  Worse than we thought, the weather changes we were worried about starting at 2° are happening, we didn't know the starting number, big oops...  Sorry.  Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye...   LoL  Naaa we can still turn it back...  The oil scientist says technology is about to be released that ends green house gas emission powered energy.  This guy works for Koch, they do have a seven story underground facility...  Vertical farms enclosed to capture gasses, open fields for grazing, not cages...  Methane can be used to power lights.  Here is a playlist of Vertical farms, no one needs to go hungry.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLISL_Z52VK2dnpy6BjzYoof_FXPXGyhho
Rjr Bl	Climate change will happen despite any efforts, it's just a reality. Canada used to be covered in ice and the sahara desert  was once lush and populated. You have a fantasy that humans can do anything about it.
Crowe	Frankly, we will likely have to terraform this planet to fix the damage we have done to it, because there is no way we will change for the better quickly enough.
AndyB	You guys really need to get Guy Mcpherson on the show.
Indrid Cold	But......but......Russia....Jimmy.
TheZodiacz	HAHAHAHAHA! How can Jimmy be duped by this bullshit? This is a POLITICAL document, it has nothing to do with science. How stupid this video looks when the cold, particularly the hail is ALREADY destroying crops worldwide. They've been saying for THIRTY YEARS that island nations will be swallowed up by the sea. How many islands have been submerged. ZERO!Fuck sakes Jimmy- how stupid are you!!!!!!
Emyr Iranian	Climate hoaxers

Janina Simons	+Hey Jimmy did you hit your head????   Usually you do some checking.  IPCC is a NWO organisation and they dont have real scientisits...Their report is bullshite to put it politely... and blondie... is an idiot and farmers put trees on their land and she didnt mention that reducing the Co2  will kill off, vegetation, animal, humans as it reduces oxygen.  AND IF you want to help go check some of the NASA and USA WAR MACHINE, weather manipulation,  and weather warfare,   CONTROLLING THE WEATHER....  SHOOT USA IS MENTALLY DERANGED OR OBEYING SATAN ... I am not sure which  There is enough land, food, coal to feed the whole world,  but the RICH ELITES dont want that, they want to reduce the population... AGENDA 21,  go read the Georgia Guidestones in USA DC I think and they spell it out for you.... Dont you notice the weird line across the sky, or the unusual abnormal cloud shapes????    DOUBLE CHECK... cause if what the IPCC states happens it will be because people were asleep and didnt notice the USA has been manipulating weather since Vietnam,,,,  the since 2011 there has not been a naturla wildfire or hurricane they have all been man made and man manipulation by those crazy scientists we used to laugh at in American dramas,  WELL THEY ARE ALIVE, WELL AND DESTROYING THE WORLD...  and you can check the patent office ..... there are thousands of patents  SAD to see you fall for this crap by the ELITITSTS
Anonymous Commenter	So climate change is worse than we thought, and we ain't gonna do shit about it. And in other news, grass is green.
Paul Sommerhalder	Remember when the scientific community claimed that the shrunk Ozone Layer would lead to the end of man?  A decade later they told us the Ozone Layer had come-back and was fine.  They scared the neck out of us, never again!
SpaceOrbison	I think the New World Order wanting to cull humanity to 500,000 human population is more dangerous than climate change.
staffan144	Well, Jimmy Dore, u managed to scare alot of people here about global warming (fear mongering and actually a f_cking liar). Listen to physics noble prize winner for example of another, not so scary perspektive on "global warming" (or due to lack of warming) "climate change": https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgM
Chazreal	Mass extinction here we come! Don't worry the Globalists Agenda 21 program will bring America into line, cleanly delegating the responsibility upon the masses while still privatizing the corporate profits.  It's STILL better than anarchy right?!

Saddle Tramp	Lol
Jason Reyes	We are done. It’s over. Enjoy it while we have it. Hug your kids. They will be the ones who truly suffer.
Gene Scheel	It's why I've been scoffing at people saying "i'm going to vote...blah, blah, blah" We're OUT OF TIME. WE NEED RADICAL CHANGE YESTERDAY! REVOLT OR DIE. THE CHOICE IS OURS! Jimmy should talk about nothing else Trump and his minions are committing PLANETARY GENOCIDE. It's not all his fault, but he's acceleratingit. TIMES UP!  WHATCHA GOING TO DO?  Blame? Point fingers:?  Go out into the streets and shut this mtherfker down? The choice is ours. Don't blame anybody by yourself. VOTE? LMAO
James clark	YOU PEOPLE ARE MINDLESS SHEEP. EVERY FUCKING DIRE PREDICTION BY THE CLIMATE CHANGE SCAMMERS FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS HAS NOT COME TRUE !  JIMMY NEEDS TO STOP READING U.N. PRESS RELEASES AND GET OFF HIS LAZY ASS AND DO SOME UNBIASED RESEARCH.
Cosmic Wakes	A new energy infrastructure would be fusion energy which requires unprecedented social organization which in turn requires communism. Therefore we must establish socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat and not Alexandre Ocasio Cortez pseudo leftism.
Seth Sternin	Watch the movie Cowspiracy. We all need to try to stop eating meat.

Augustei	Those that don't believe in Climate Change should check out potholer54's videos, guy's great at debunking pseudoscience
Lucas	REDWOOD forests of California sequester more carbon per acre than any other type of forest even many times more than rainforest. Redwood logging in California should be banned asap
Doctor Fantastic	Nah.
ArmyOfAll	For the record, it's not worse than I thought, as I have been writing about events which the IPCC has only just caught up with for years. The reality is the IPCC is still being conservative and is involved in magical thinking, believing technology will allow infinite growth capitalist economics to outrun the physics of a finite world. Part of the blame for this lays with working group 3, a department inside the IPCC that has a heavy influence over what is said and published, working group 3 comprises primarily of neoclassical capitalist economists, not scientists.  More on that in video 1  Capitalism itself, is incompatible with the physics required to halt human driven climate change before it drives us all off a cliff. Indeed it may have already done so.  https://armyofall.wordpress.com/capitalism-climate-change-an-update/  https://armyofall.wordpress.com/welcome-to-rapid-climate-change-a-list-of-what-we-know/  https://armyofall.wordpress.com/co2/  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo-r5Q-5TWB43oLI8eZ6euA  Video 1.

Christopher Bojorquez	I’m planting more trees in my front yard.
Gandalf the white	Its worse then this report details the tipping point was reached years ago . in short we are in what's known as a exponential phase . things are going to get bad and when they do the change will come on fast . climate was never an issue it was our destruction of the ecosystems that has brought us into the 6th extinction.
Samuel Untermeyer created Federal Reserve &Israel	So SEC is harassing Elon Musk... we do in most fields opposite of common sense. It’s by design.
allon33	Jimmy the warming was around 2000, it is now cooling, because Sun is going through a new 'grand solar minimum', and we are in trouble, not from heating, but cooling.
Chowdy Chowdars	You Jimmy, who is skeptical of the American plutocracy, believes the UN plutocracy.
Wretch Gunk	If people knew what is necessary to stop climate change there would be rioting the streets, capitalists do not understand the idea of consuming less, it does not compute, Any way you measure it the environment is fucked, quite apart from global warming, capitalism is a death cult.
Black Eagle	First it was global cooling,  oops!    We mean there's Global warming.  oops!     Er  we mean climate change..............yeah that's it climate change.    Sorry no wonder so many people will not believe.   You know the boy that cried wolf  story was told and retold for a reason.  Oh before I forget.   Keep talking about carbon TAXES!   And then wonder why people reject it.
Anthony Baiocchi	I live in Scotland, a mile inland - I'm building a jetty and stocking up on sunblock and buying deckchairs.😎
StraightDope	I very rarely thumbs down a video,  but Jimmy...that entire article is devoid of actual science.   At best, it's speculating from speculation...or as the guy who named Climate Change would call it, Specujection.
madPaulX	Destroying the planet for greed.
Scottish Independence	Why Jimmy, why are you so bang on the button and level headed about so many things then you fall for this bs. Don't you understand they cherry pick, and it is all to tax the poor. Cheers Jimmy, help them tax us more. They are taxing people with a spare bedroom now in Scotland, seriously, taxed for having a spare bedroom. And now want them taxing the very air we breath, nice one Jimmy. #sudim
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ	I don't care, if I'd care, I'd go insane. Cause it's obvious humanity will be incapable of handling it.
Trent Quinn	Hahahahahahahahahaha bullshit. You're content since coming back after the regressive's started eating you is getting more absurd. Afraid the gravy train might dry up? It's so obvious
northern1639	Global Warming/ Climate Change is a bankers scam. How can anyone give credence to this total nonsense.
Mark 7's	We're already dead! There's no way we could get everyone to agree on what to do let alone do it. Some won't even see the problem until it's far to late to fix it. If they will even do it then.

mkeyx82	Review this information, please. https://www.corbettreport.com/the-carbon-bubble-cometh-and-open-thread/
Howard Coombe	Thank you for this information.
Tom Ashley	No, the United States isn't not living up to it "Because Trump pulled out." The US and other countries aren't living up to it because the agreement DID NOTHING! Carbon taxes don't....fix...Anything and are a complete waste of money which is why Trump pulled out of the accord.
hypo krites	The UN and EU don't actually provide any value. They tax people for the privilege of scaring them. Wasn't 2020 supposed to be the be all end all a few years ago. Guess what, climate change killed the dinosaurs, it is dangerous, but guess what alse is dangerous unquantified and and unqualified arguments that play on people's fear and lack of critical thinking. That kind of stuff butchers millions. There was far worse climate problems in the early 2000s and 1930s than right now. And guess what, it will probably suck in 2070 or so. When the climate scientists who make their livelihoods off of pushing an agenda that is sponsored by the likes of guys like the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, and other mega family names around the globe who are only interested in treating people like cattle.... Well, what can I say, I am not sympathetic, terrorism is bull shit, and so is this climate scam. Things change, and we can choose for ourselves whether or not we want to adapt, we don't need to be taxed for the favor, and we don't need to be insulted for believing in half baked thinking. Just say no to Hell Fire.
Rachel Easton	Yep, and nothing will be done about it.
Bas Koning	Jimmy! Jimmy! What is your opinion on the name 'The Young Turks'? Do you think it might point to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turks#1915%E2%80%931918:_Armenian_Genocide Or do you think thats a coïncidence, and they just chose that name because they are Turks, and 'young'?  An honest question I wanted to ask you for a while. I would appreciate your opinion on this very much.
