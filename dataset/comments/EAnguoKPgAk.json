Thank you.', 'Mack': 'We are a very small minority. Unlike the Reds or Blues we don\'t have a name yet. And we don\'t have a color coded pill. For now we just call ourselves "truthers." \nTruthers know the usual traitorous suspects in the elite pedo-sexual orbit and beyond are the ones all of you can relate to, people like the Clinton family, Obama family, Bush family, NWO, illuminati, Rothschild family, PedoWood and the Zionist jew\'s. Truthers hope they are harshly punished for their evil crimes.\n\nNow comes Trump. Truthers have awakened to the fact that Trump is in the same camp with the Clinton\'s and Obama\'s though (maybe) minus the pedo-sexuality. Truthers know that the slogan used by Qanon, "Trust the Plan," is a catchy brain washing tool created by the Rothschild NWO illuminati, jew Zionist network in an effort to capture the sheep en masse\'. The truther awakening I refer to is slow and gradual.\n\nEnter Johnny Gat. Johnny Gat\'s video\'s prove: \n- Trump has no intention of bringing justice to 9/11 false flag attack. \n- He has no intention of dismantling the CIA. \n- Trump knew 9/11 was coming a full 19 months in advance of 9/11. \n- Israeli boss Benjamin Netanyahu predicted WTC destruction was coming months in advance of 9/11/2001 (like Trump predicted). \n- Trump puts Israeli MOSSAD first, ahead of America. \n- Trump has no intention of bringing justice to JFK assassination.\n- Proves Israel is at the root of the worlds terror, including many war\'s, false flag attacks, including 9/11 false flag attack.\n\nObviously the war of information is even more muddled than it ever was before. Which means you can not trust those who swear by Qanon MAGA, frauds who claim to be "truthers," people like:\n- POTUS\n- Qanon\n- PrayingMedic\n- James Woods\n- SGTReport\n- USAWatchDog\n- Greg Hunter\n- Kevin Shipp\n- Craig Sawyer\n- Edge of Wonder\n- Liz Corkin\n- Alex Jones\n- Isaac Kappy\n- Destroying the Illusion\n- Oliver Stone\n- Tommy Robinson\n- Milo Yiannopoulos\n- Lauren Southern\n- Stefan Molyneux\n- Mike Cernovich\n- Pat Condell\n- Mark Dice \n- Steven Crowder\n- Paul Joseph Watson\n- Jordan Peterson\n- James Red Pills America\n- AMTV Chris Greene\n- Peter Sweden\n- Jared Taylor\n- Jerome Corsi\n- Lou Dobbs\n- Harley Schlanger\n- Lisa Haven\n- X22Report Spotlight\nAnd that\'s just the short list in a long line of thousand\'s of online figures who spread disinformation that favors the Trump, Qanon, NWO, illuminati, Rothschild jew Zionist network. Some of the above work as agents for Israel in an effort to change your mind. Which is one reason why 9/11 flight attendant Rebekah Roth does not allow comments. Ms. Roth, a truther, shows pictures of Israeli MOSSAD agents planting fuses in the WTC days before 9/11. Pictures that were leaked to the public by the DEA. Pictures that Donald Trump, and Qanon, refuse to acknowledge to the public. Those pics can be seen at the 31m 31s mark in her video titled - "SGTreport BOMBSHELL: METHODICAL DECEPTION -- Rebekah Roth"\n\nBack to Johnny Gat. As of today content producer Johnny Gat is still on Youtube, but his shelf life may not last long. When I post messages like this I have seen pro Trump and pro Israeli MOSSAD propagandists post a response stating: \n\n"9/11 is no longer an issue!!" \n                      or\n"Don\'t worry, 9/11 justice is coming!!"\n\nMany Americans would not like being told 9/11 is no longer an issue. And there are facts that prove Trump does not intend to ever seek justice for those responsible for 9/11 or for the JFK assassination.\n\nThe primary Johnny Gat video that I recommend watching for exposing Trump and Qanon, the Youtube videos that show damning proof of the aforementioned allegations, are the one\'s titled:\n"Donald Trump, 9/11, CASE CLOSED - johnny gat" \n                         and\n"Donald Trump, 9/11, CASE CLOSED 2 - johnny gat" \n\nIf you\'re a truther like 9/11 flight attendant Rebekah Roth is, you should have no problem connecting the dots.

And I believe I saw where Trump signed something saying that if anyone is caught doing something that will cause major damage to the property of others their finances can be taken to off-set the cost of reparations.

Perhaps you can help us out, having a good grasp of President Trump & the Q Team\'s strategies.   \n\nWhy would Trump hire Bolton?    https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/it-sure-looks-like-john-bolton-is-trying-to-sabotage-the-north-korea-talks.html   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4pAAXhdwqk    I only include this second (terrible) video (which assuredly was seen by Putin and Kim) to underline how inexcusable mentioning what happened to Gaddafi after he gave up his nuclear weapons was.  I\'m sure that he must have reasonably asked himself, who\'s really in charge, and can Trump truly deliver his end of the bargain?  Furthermore, why did Trump surrender General Flynn (who supported no regime change in Syria and rapprochement with Russia) so easily?  The same could be said for Pompeo\'s appointment to head the CIA.  For that matter, why would Obama let Petraeus lose so easily?  That "scandal" was obviously BS.  I always thought Obama feared being taken out by the Secret Service.  I assume that\'s why Trump tried to keep his own security team.   If I knew why these things happened I\'d have a deeper understanding of what\'s going on in the world. \n\nAny discussion of these points would be most welcome, and congratulations on (IMHO) one of the best Q Anon analysis websites I\'ve run across in the last two years.

Jury trial vs the mob with a rope.  The jury is the "cooler head" deliberating over evidence to arrive at a determination. If the jury is duly impaneled and hears all the facts why would I ever pretend to know more than they. \n2. Republic vs Democracy.  Democracy says we\'ll all get a vote and sure enough every week we would get something new as the Mob that includes all of us would be voting for something different. Let cooler heads prevail. \nOur hat to wear as a citizen of the USA includes voting every 2, 4 and 6 years to replace those that do not represent us and our best interests.

It should be easy now that you don\'t have a TV. \nAnd just a note in closing,  If a person can\'t see what has improved and changed in the last 2 years then it\'s very obvious that they are not factually "LOOKING" and need to improve in that area.

Depending on how the midterms turn out, the equation may change. \n\nThe hard truth is that the only person who could have helped Trump was Trump himself. He should have fired Sessions the day he recused, and he should have fired Rosenstein and Mueller the day he appointed the Special Counsel.

THE EXPRESSIONS, OR TEACHINGS, OF THE DEMONS AND THEIR MASTER SATAN, THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TELL US WILL "GO OUT"  OR EXECUTE/SET-IN-MOTION THE EVENTS WHICH, BECAUSE OF THEIR OPPOSITION TO GOD AND  *HIS*  PURPOSE,  FACILITATE PART OF THE COMPOSITE SIGN JESUS HIMSELF SPOKE OF AS MARKING THE "LAST DAYS" OF THIS SYSTEM. MOREOVER, THEY WILL SET OUT TO DESTROY GODS PEOPLE AT A FUTURE TIME BY MISLEADING THE NATIONS (WHO ARE WILLFULLY MISLEAD) INTO AN ALL OUT ATTACK BY MEANS OF "SIGNS" THEY PERFORM. YES, THEY WILL  "GATHER THE KINGS OF THE ENTIRE INHABITED EARTH TOGETHER FOR THE WAR OF THE GREAT DAY OF  *GOD THE ALMIGHTY*  ". (REV. 16:13) THE TYPE/POWER OF THE SIGNS JESUS HIMSELF KNEW THEY WOULD BE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO PERFORM PROMPTED HIM TO ISSUE A  *STRONG*  WARNING TO HIS DISCIPLES. RECALL JESUS\' WORDS AT MATTHEW 24:24 WHEN STATED TO HIS DISCIPLES THAT THE SIGNS/WORKS  GRANTED TO THEM (SATAN/DEMONS) TO "PERFORM"  WOULD  *"MISLEAD"* IF POSSIBLE  *EVEN THE CHOSEN (ELECT) ONES*  "; HE CONCLUDED THAT STATEMENT BY CONTINUING ON IN VERSE 25 TO SAY THAT NOT ONLY WAS IT A WARNING BUT PLAINLY THEN SAID TO "NOT BELIEVE IT". BELIEVE WHAT? THE PROPAGANDA AND MESSAGE OF THE WORLD AND IT\'S SUPPORTER(S) AND RULER THAT CLEVERLY ATTEMPT TO DRAW IN AND REALIGN OUR THINKING TO/WITH THE WORLD\'S THINKING AND THUS ERODE OUR BIBLE TRAINING, CONSCIENCE AND SLOWLY OVER TIME, EVEN OUR CHRISTIAN STANDARDS. (1 JOHN 5:19) YES, JESUS WARNED HIS FOLLOWERS NOT TO  "BE DECEIVED" AND PAUL ECHOED THIS SENTIMENT IN HIS LETTER TO THE CONGREGATION IN THESSALONIKI WHEN HE STERNLY WARNED THOSE IN THE CONGREGATION TO AVOID "BEING QUICKLY SHAKEN FROM YOUR [GODLY] REASON". (2 THESS. 2:1,2) JAMES TOO HIGHLIGHTED THE SNARE OF DECEIVING ONE\'S SELF WITH "FALSE" (OR UNGODLY) "REASONING" AND REMINDS US THAT BEING A FOLLOWER IS BY NO MEANS PASSIVE; IT IS AN ACTIVE OCCUPATION IN EVERY RESPECT. (JAMES 1:22) BEARING IN MIND THAT SATAN WELL KNOWS & UNDERSTANDS JUST HOW MUCH HUMANS WANT/DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT\'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND TO FEEL SAFE & SECURE FROM THE UNKNOWN, WE SHOULD BE PROMPTED TO GIVE  *ADDED*  SCRUTINY TO ANY INFORMATION OR INVITATION(S) THE WORLD EXTENDS TO US; KNOWING THAT HE EXPLOITS OUR IMPERFECTIONS AND WEAKNESSES WITH THE AIM OF PULLING YOU TOTALLY INTO THE WORLD AND THEREFORE TOTALLY AWAY FROM GOD. THE IMPERFECTION IN OUR HUMAN HEARTS AND MINDS CAN CAUSE US TO REASON UNSOUNDLY (IN AN UNSCRIPTURAL WAY) ON MATTERS; CONSIDER THE WORDS AT JEREMIAH 17: 9, 10. THEREFORE, GIVEN THE EXAMPLES IN THE SCRIPTURES, THE WARNINGS AND SOUND INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR US WITHIN THOSE BOOKS, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON ALL  *TRUE CHRISTIANS*  TO DILIGENTLY AND CONTINUOUSLY WORK AT BRINGING BOTH THEIR THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS INTO HARMONY WITH HIS RIGHTEOUS STANDARDS/LAWS/REGULATIONS. AND TO THEREFORE REASON ON MATTERS USING THE INSIGHT AVAILABLE, THAT HE HAS LOVINGLY PROVIDED AS A GUIDE FOR US, WITHIN THE PAGES OF HIS WORD (2 TIM. 3:16) DESPITE STRUGGLES WE FACE "AGAINST THE FLESH". A SOUND, SCRIPTURALLY TRAINED MIND & [MORAL] CONSCIENCE THAT IS FILLED WITH ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE FROM THE WORD OF GOD IS NOT AS EASY TO FOOL. SUCH A PERSON MUST CONCEDE THAT THE STATEMENTS AND/OR INFORMATION PROVIDED/CLAIMED BY  *ANY*  PERSON ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH =>  *MUST BE* EVALUATED WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF SAID SPIRITUAL PARADIGM AND GIVEN CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, WITH RESPECT TO CHRISTIAN DISCERNMENT, ACCORDINGLY AND IN PARTICULAR  WITH DEFERENCE TO KEEPING 1 JOHN 5:19 IN THE FOREGROUND OF OUR THOUGHTS. THE WORLD,  *ITS*  THINKING, ITS MASTER/RULER, THE GOVERNMENTS ESTABLISHED THEREBY/THEREIN AND EVERY SUPPORTER OF THEM PRACTICE AND PROMOTE MIND-SETS, TEACHINGS & IDEOLOGIES CONTRARY TO THOSE OF GOD. THESE THEREFORE ARE RIGHTLY ARE PICTURED WITHIN THE SCRIPTURES AS STANDING IN OPPOSITION TO HIM & HIS PURPOSE. IT WAS JESUS WHO  *CLEARLY*  STATED THAT NEITHER HE OR HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD BE (OR ARE)  *"PART OF THE WORLD"*  .  THUS, UNDERSTANDING  *WHAT*  "NO PART OF THE WORLD"  *MEANS*  IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN OUR DAY IS ALSO OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO TRUE CHRISTIANS AROUND THE WORLD WHO DESIRE TO DEVELOP, KEEP AND MAINTAIN A  *FINE STANDING*  WITH GOD; THESE WILL REJECT THE WORLD, ITS THINKING, IDEOLOGIES & TEACHINGS [INCLUDING PATRIOTISM] BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE THEM FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE: SNARES OF THE DEVIL=> THE ENEMY OF GOD. (COL. 2:8) ANYONE PURSUING/WANTING/CLAIMING DISCIPLESHIP NEEDS TO SERIOUSLY & PRAYERFULLY MEDITATE ON THESE POINTS.  *"YOU CANNOT SLAVE FOR TWO MASTERS"*  (MT. 6:24 & LUKE 6:13; 1 COR. 10:21)  *YOU CANNOT SERVE GOD AND THE WORLD.*  NO ONE CAN.  MOREOVER,  *"THE WORLD IS PASSING AWAY AND SO IS ITS DESIRE".*  THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS WHEN EVALUATING "Q" AND INDEED ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITY. JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF (OUR EXEMPLAR) STAYED COMPLETELY POLITICALLY NEUTRAL IN THE AFFAIRS OF HIS DAY DESPITE IMMENSE PRESSURE FROM THOSE WHO AT ONE POINT WANTED TO SEIZE HIM TO [FORCIBLY] MAKE HIM KING OVER THEM AND, IN ADDITION TO THESE, SET OUT, TO ENSNARE HIM POLITICALLY, TO PROVOKE HIM TO TAKING A STAND ON THE POLITICAL \'HOT-BUTTON\' ISSUE OF THE DAY WITH A PUBLICLY ASSERTED DIRECT QUESTION OVER THE ROMAN TAX [ISSUE] AND USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY WITHIN THE TEMPLE COMPLEX. (JOHN 6:15; MT. 22:21; MARK 12:17 & LUKE 20:25) SO WHEN THINKING ON HOW BEST TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF OUR KING CHRIST JESUS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A GIVEN SITUATION, IN TERMS OF POLITICAL NEUTRALITY, ASK YOURSELF: DOES THIS PERSON, INFORMATION AND/OR APPARENT MOTIVE STAND ON THE SIDE OF OR SUPPORT GOD OR HIS PURPOSE? IS IT A MESSAGE AND/OR POSITION CONSISTENT WITH THE STANCE THE BIBLE CLEARLY OUTLINES [TAKES] ON THE MATTER? OR DOES THIS PERSON/INFORMATION/ISSUE REST ON THE SIDE OF THE POLITICAL POWERS AND  *THEIR*  AGENDA(S)? REMEMBER, GOD ESTABLISHED HIS OWN KINGDOM AND HIS OWN RULER FOR IT. (DANIEL 2:44; EZ. 21:25-27; 37:22; 2 PETER 1:21; JOHN 3:16; MT. 1:16;  MT. 3:17; JOHN 19:33; ACTS 2:24; LUKE 24:44; HEBREWS 2:17; 1 JOHN 4:10) IN FACT, IT IS  *THAT KINGDOM* (OR GOVERNMENT) WHICH HE FIRST ESTABLISHED IN THE HEAVENS THAT WILL,  IN THE  *VERY*  NEAR FUTURE, PERMANENTLY REMOVE AND PUT AN END TO  *ALL*  OTHER [EARTHLY] GOVERNMENTS; THE GOVERNMENTS OF MAN AND OF SATAN\'S SYSTEM ARE NOT ORIGINATING WITH GOD AND ACTUALLY STAND IN OPPOSITION TO GOD  *AND HIS PURPOSE*  ; GOD HIMSELF MADE THIS KNOWN THROUGH HIS WORD AND MESSIAH CHRIST JESUS. THE FUTURE HOPE FOR HUMANITY TO BE RESTORED HERE UPON THE EARTH IS  *IN POINT OF FACT*  THEE PRIMARY REASON FOR  *WHY*  THE SCRIPTURES WERE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST PLACE; IN ORDER THAT ALL PERSONS, EVERY LAST HUMAN ON EARTH,   *MAY BECOME AWARE OF THEIR HOPE AND CHOOSE WHO THEY STAND BESIDE*  : CHOOSE LIFE OR CHOOSE DEATH. I, FOR MY PART, STAND WITH GOD AND  *NOT*  THE "KINGS OF THE EARTH" (PSALMS 138:4; DU. 30:11-16; MICAH 6:8; 2 PETER 3:11-13; 1 JOHN 5:3)  *PLEASE CAREFULLY READ (CONSIDER) ALL THE SCRIPTURAL REFERENCES CONTAINED HEREIN FOR CLARIFICATION AS TO THE BIBLE BASED REASONING AND SCRIPTURAL JUSTIFICATION CITED FOR THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN*  ,  THANK YOU!

Prob think that\'s an oxymoron.  I know you hate or dislike me. But I find this both fascinating and disturbing. I just have a few questions. Questions I humbly  ask. I\'m sorry for length. I want you to know who i am and who your speaking to. I have about zero influence power. I am zero threat to anyone. Im naturally curious by nature. I don\'t take glee in laughing at others for what they think. I have some radical views of which we would all disagree with each other on. And i\'m sure misconceptions of each other too. Questions. \n\nI have watched many q code deciphers. Some with more religious tones that others. Some more sane to me than others. Yours fall into that category. Some frankly plane silly to me. What I wish to know is it seems the one thing you agree on although I can\'t tell about you from this single video but some insinuation. \n\n1) Do you believe that someday there will be arrests of hillary clinton, many others and at some point soon after and Marshal law imposed by trump to wipe out the "evil liberal agenda?" is that partially or basically correct? \n\n B Clarification - And you think this to be needed? I don\'t mean to imply this means round up us libs and kill us all. I think you mean what you consider to be bad liberal judges, politicians etc for crimes your perceive a threat to the nation?\n\nAlso what I have taken from what I have seen on your forums and videos ( I mean qanon ones 4chan 8chan etc)  is -\n\n3) Do you believe that you are part of the largest covert military op on earth to basically achieve these directives. Is this true? Again not here to make fun of views. I have researched on my own but rather than draw conclusions as there seems to be some differences in interpretations. And perhaps some bad actors taking advantage reaping reward via donations for their deciphers but I could be wrong on that and they are impassioned believers\n\n\nThe person speaking seems sane rational. I agree about emotional clickbait emotional media to be avoided. I would also say that most people dont know the diff between opinion commentators reporters and journalists. All media news has both. The world would be better served if all knew the difference. \n\nI dont understand why you put so much faith in Q but its not for me to judge. You have many proud military in your groups. while I may disagree with their politics most I have found to be sane but dismissive unwilling to talk to a liberal. I don\'t lie I never pretend to be what I am not. and i will apologize to my most admit enemy if I am in the wrong on something. Which I do often yet to get a reply.\n \nIn closing im curious. I find it strange admittedly. I\'ve seen some conclusions drawn from vague mumbles from trump to believers of someone who says in Prayer with a council of angels who speak to him about msgs from Q or something like that. While I personally find hard to swallow. I also know sane rational people can believe in many things im not here to judge. As an atheist and I dislike that term its not that I dont believe there could be a creator but that I dont believe people know and I need my own proof. Looking at this world I could easily draw it more likely created. But undecided. \n\nLast question. I assume and have heard that Q predicted things he or she could have never known but yet too evidence of this. Can you point any?\n\nI realize this effort to prob be too long and in vain but I hope we can have civil discourse on or off line.', 'professorhoodoo': 'Cooper...you need to investigate alien false flag', 'GiGi W.': 'Thank you, PM.

Nevertheless God is going to allow evil to come in like a flood upon America no matter what, and for one reason and for one reason only, and that reason is to force people onto their knees, as God is going to force people to use their freewill that God gave them to either choose to Believe and Repent Unto the Lord Thy God Jesus Christ, or to deny Him altogether and choose to embrace evil by default..\n\nWhether God allows natural disasters, weather manipulation, aliens (demons), the deep state, or any of our many enemies to bring us to our knees so that we will be forced to make that choice is irrelevant. The point is America has already reached the point of no return and so she will keep seeing more and more destruction upon not only her lands, but of her people because America and American\'s sins are an affront and an abomination unto the Lord Almighty God.\n\nTime is up people! It is way beyond Praying to God and begging Him to stop His judgments! It\'s only about Believing and Praying Unto God to Save Your Spiritual Soul before you physically Die, and it\'s about Repenting of all of Your sins unto Jesus Christ now before it is too late. Why? Because this is the only choice that will save you. Everything and All else is both futile and a waste of the short time America has left.\n\nIf you, "Praying Medic" are filled with the Holy Spirit like you say that you are, then Pray and ask God about the Words that I just wrote above and let the Holy Spirit Discern them for you and ask whether the Words I AM speaking are True or False and then act accordingly.\n\nThere\'s nothing wrong with being a Patriot, but it has always been God and then country! Not Me, Myself and I, Fortune, Power Fame, then Country and no God! Why? Because our Nation was founded upon the One True God! The God of Judeo/Christianity! Not the God of Pride, Mammon, Baal, Baphomet, Fame, Fortune, Sex,Homosexuality, Abortion, Pedophilia,  Lewdness, Lasciviousness, Ego, War Mongering, or Prosperity through Capitalism without God, as these are the gods that America and American\'s worship today!\n\nGod will never continue to Bless or Protect a nation of sinners or their leaders, who refuse to Believe in Him and who do not Repent unto the Lord thy God Jesus Christ of the daily sins! Especially if many of these same people are secret anti-semites, who hate Gods chosen people, or if their leaders are trying to blackmail the nation of Israel (the Apple of God\'s Eye), into a Two-State Solution to divide up the Land of Israel, the land that God gave to the Israeli people, and especially not if they are trying to give Israeli land unto a godless nation of palestinians who have no legitimate claims to Israeli land or the city of Jerusalem whatsoever, not to mention that President Trump is only trying to puff up his own ego by wanting to be, not only the first President in history to resolve the middle east peace process, but the first businessman to ever do so, and you can believe he will try to profit off of it somehow or in someway for sure, or he wouldn\'t be the business man that he thinks he is! However one thing is certain God is in charge and He will not be mocked by a haughty prideful buffoon. Put not your faith in any man saith the Lord. America shall never be great again without putting God first, and in the end every knee shall bow, one way or the other. Tired of Winning?

The righteous learn and obey Jesus commandments alone and not the words doctrines and tradions of men.   All men have free to do all manner of sin and EVIL.  At times in God's word God intervenes  and prevents acts and actions.   Saul seeking to kill David was thwarted by God,  Elijah was kept Daniel and the three,    In the Gospels is says of Christ but his time was not yet.   So much taught in the church is fraught with the doctrines and tradition of men,  The buildings. Their furnature,   The order of the Church service,  down even to the collection plates and offerings.  \n\nOf this ministry Jesus in Matthew 24 described the church with the words FALSE TEACHERS and HIRELINGS.    God in the Old Testament had commandments and expectations of every Jew that ever was and shall be,  In the New Testament Jesus  had words commandments and deeds all of which are required of every believer,   I work with the Greek and fund many words in translations have been shaded to point the different denominational tranditions depending whose version it is.   \n\nWhen Jesus in KJV says depart from me ye that work iniquity the Greek word is Anomian are without law,  lawless,  but specifically breaking the law of Jesus commandments and Jesus confirms this charge in other passages where the words have not been shaded.   The Old Covenamt and the New Covenant both are filled with expectations  of God and Christ.   American law and government depends a lot on personal honor and trust. The expectation is that most people are lawful.  \n\nIt was only Jefferson that foresaw utter corruption of the Government and we know what he wrote of that.   When I deligate responcibility I do absolutely and tell them they will be fully accountable for their actions.  \n\nI have expectations and when the law is laid down firmly and consistancy people respond.  But when one is failiing in a position  that they can not meet expectations they must be given notice to either step up to the task or be fured.  Trump on his show with candidates for Jobs was all about that.  God in the bible was all about that and Jesus in the New Testament made many  commandments of His disciples.  \n\nFirst that they were to be his disciples ALONE,  No man shall have two masters.  That was a binding commandment.  No apostles had disciples, but today men that have been dead for hundreds of years all have disicples where their commandments are used to nullify jesus words and commandments.   When a man makes disciples and gives commandments that nullify the words and commandments of Christ they are not Jesus disciple and their words are of a false teacher.   False begining with their foundational character that they NEVER became a disciple of Christ first and foremost so that they can not partake of any of Christ's promises.  And neither do their brand name churches.   Powerless they furthered their corruption to create doctrines to show themselves just and declare God's power is past.   \n\nCorruption ever emboldens as we see in Progressives.  \n\nI  remember the 1960's and what liberals said then and have watched how that chianged,  I came to Christ in the EARLY 1970's and have watched corruption work in all churches and denominattions to a staggaring level with populist teaching and doctrines  overthrowing all.  What was commonly preached and teached  has been cast aside.      \n\nIn the same manner progressives have cast aside large portions of the constifution and support  lawlessness in the biblcal sense.  That is they will not obey any authorities, they are in utter rebellion to all that is civil law,  decency, God,  Christ,  the bible, and Christianity and they have been all about blotting all of that out.  \n\nExpectation are foundational in scripture.  \n\nNUFF SAID", 'Rain Drops': 'Hello Praying Medic Seeking Q please pick a shirt here so I can send it to you. represent.com/store/seeking-q Thank you for all your work!

Sure, they aren't described as little green men, but they aren't exactly described as being that humanlike either (some are described as having six wings, and several animal faces, all on one creature), but that's not really the point.

Nearly every US president is aware of this, and those that don\'t are simply not in the loop.  All UFO information is given strictly on a "Need To Know" basis, and that\'s the way it\'s been since Truman put a lid on it in 1947.\n\nSecond, although it is true that nearly everyone is swayed by emotion, the very fact that you always invoke the name of "God" in your videos amply demonstrate this fact, and the fact is, the use of religion, ANY religion, is a direct appeal to emotion.  I had a fundamentalist Christian upbringing, but not everyone who watches You Tube are Christians.  Whether you want to agree with me or not, "faith" is not "fact."  Therefore, you are as guilty as any hardcore advertiser in this regard, the only difference is the product or belief you are supporting.  If memory serves, Jesus was staunchly against mixing religion and politics, and I heartily agree.  That said, my belief in Freedom of Speech overrides any of my personal feelings in the matter.\n\nFinally... nearly every talking head on YT has been vigorously pushing for "indictments" or "severe legal penalties," aka prison time, for all those who participated in federal crimes against the POTUS, and others.  They are in nearly universal agreement on this.  The reason I believe that legal prosecutions are the ONLY way to completely rid Trump\'s cabinet of these interlopers is clear:  Simply "draining the swamp" by FIRING people or allowing them to "resign" isn\'t going to accomplish much in the long term, simply because there are so many criminals and psychopaths in Washington ready, willing, and able to take their place.  Just like fleas and cockroaches, you\'ll never eradicate them all.  The only way to at least slow them down is to jail a few of them, not "thousands" of them as they claim.  Mass prosecutions will cause far more ill will among Americans than just taking down the bigwigs.  When you publicly arrest just one CEO or Senator, their underlings will scatter like rats leaving a sinking ship.  This very thing has already been demonstrated by the people of Iceland, who threw all their central bankers into prison after squandering their tax money on fake investments.  Many so-called "experts" around the world (mainly bankers) warned that this would "destroy" a country\'s economy, but the very next year, Iceland\'s economy rallied, big time.\n\nI watch your videos often, you have my unwavering support and I hope you are right in all things.

As I see it, the timing of what is unveiled and actioned upon, and when it is actioned upon, is very crucial, as the President and other White Hats, must at the same time secure infrastructure, and try to protect the American People from FF reprisals from the Deep State that he knows they will try.  The criminals had the keys to the buildings, so to speak, and to everything else, for a very long time, and have had backdoor access to everything. They have hidden weapon systems too that had to be found. Electronics, extensive software, and much more has had to be reconfigured to lock rogue bad actors out of the capability to use certain weapons against all of us. There are still rogue INTEL Community actors hidden in agencies who are engaged in the planning and deployment of  weapons and assassins against citizens...I know of that one personally and what they do when you get in the way of their illegal money. \n\nIn addition to removing more subversive operatives out of government positions, trying to secure infrastructure and the safety of Americans from attacks by the Deep State, the President and other White Hats,  have had to deal with trying to fix the problems with  corrupt Judges,DA's, corrupt shadow government subversive actors from Obama Clinton and Bush administrations,  corrupt members of Congress, and long lists of foreign subversive actors. These people made sure they had all the keys, and they made assassination attempts against the President, and have had witnesses to their crimes assassinated. These are ruthless and treacherous criminals. At times, I was  impatient myself about when the arrests were coming, because these traitors are walking free and are dangerous, but then I looked at it all more closely, and realized how much our Country had been infiltrated for a takeover, and what it would take to safeguard the Country, and steer the ship away from the coming coup d' etat disaster that had been planned for decades.

There are the little things we can expect to happen & mostly not find disappointment in because they're based on repeated actions & outcomes. Turning a handle & pulling on a door for example. We expect the door to open & it does 99.9% of the time. But when we plug more complex interaction with the environment (especially with other peoples' actions) into the equation, we set ourselves up for disappointment, & if we do this repeatedly the outcomes worsen. How on average, does one cope with repeated disappointment? It ain't pretty though it may not look so bad at distance. But if we could climb inside & feel what others feel, or if we were around them constantly we'd find very negative things. All high in stress. We'd find hidden beneath a very thin vail things like anger, resentment, depression, & hopelessness or helplessness. Apathy. All things that we handle & hide differently, but all equally unhealthy to every one of us. The trick is to be solidly planted in reality. Its easier in every aspect that way anyway so I don't understand why we don't seem to naturally gravitate there, but that's a different topic. Back on point, if we are realistic, we know how many variables there are as complexity rises, & therefore know our own flexibility should also rise. I could probably write a book on this, so I'll end it here.

First: I agree with you on most of this; however,  TRUSTing a plan that we do not know is APPOINTING Q which is the only way one can be DISAPPOINTED.  I do not appoint Q, but take Q as very genuine.  I read Q ALL THE TIME on my own and I thank you and others who also decode and fill in some blanks for me.  I would suspect the biggest disappointment comes because Q posts things that seem to imply immediacy to certain outcomes.  It is also hard to know when Q is using disinfo vs. real info for us.\n\nI agree with you that Wray AND Sessions are patriots.  I trusted Q when he told us WHOM to trust .. even KANSAS.  It is very difficult to understand why we have so much info on people like HRC now, and they are not being indicted for Military tribunals - optics?  So, for me, it is not disappointment I FEEL, but it IS mental fatigue.  How come we still have chemtrails (Stratospheric Aerosol Injections (SAI's)) in our skies, for example?   Yes - I agree that firing people first, in order to get testimony on the record, is a necessary first step, but why do I see these people still spewing venom on public media AFTER they have turned on other bad guys?\n\nFinal note:  Q tells us to trust ourselves, etc.  But then, if we do, Q is asking us not to act; for example, Q is asking us to use restraint in fighting the radical left (Some of us FEEL this is allowing ourselves to be beaten up or raped by these evil ones.).  This is contradictory advice.  I find myself explaining to family reasons WHY things have not happened yet, and I believe the real reasons are due to incorrect decoding, disinfo by Q as he alerted us would be the case, and changes in military combat against the DS as this semi-silent war always needs to be modified.  I would think the public, including myself, would be better served if Q told us accomplishments after they happened, such as that list in the Batter's Box, and that term does not mean the remaining bad guys, it means who is up next with the rest of the DS in the dugout.\n\nIf the left attacks anyone in my area, and the police don't shut them down, the people SHOULD respond, IMO.

I don't believe RM is incompetent. Corrupt - yes, incompetent or dumb, no way. So ask then what is RM's purpose and shrouded in even more mystery what is RR's role? Something that I have been toying with for awhile is RM's role is distraction, nothing more or nothing less. And the end game of both RR and RM is to get Congress so incensed that the optics of a DECLAS changes from RM to Congress in the MSM and provides the political cover for POTUS to Declass.

If you listen to the Dems at all, they are saying POTUS is just a speedbump, after which they will resume their rapid progress toward destroying America and inserting their Marxist idea of heaven.

This is a very important piece of context, because it reveals two things. The first is that the genocide of Canaan (deep state) was planned long before the victims of Joshua were even born (child pedo, satan worship, theft, murder, treason, etc). The second is that Abraham, as well as his descendants through Moses, were foreigners in the land.\n\nGenesis 7:8 – “The whole land of Canaan (America), where you now reside as a foreigner (the 1st settlers), I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you (that\'s us); and I will be their God.”\n\nExodus 6:4 – “I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan (America) where they resided as foreigners"...', 'R Kenna': "Things ARE happening.

I think many of your points about our patience and emotions are very true, but I also think that Q is playing our emotions.  You listed several tactical headlines that the media uses to get us emotionally charged.  Q does the same thing.  Q puts out posts that tap into emotion and lead us to believe that big things are coming this week and on & on & on & on.  My personal frustration comes from this exact thing.  Q gets us all amped up as if huge things are going to happen soon, and then nothing.  Two weeks later "huge things are coming, get you popcorn ready", and then once again nothing. If Q is concerned about frustration, then STOP playing our emotions and posting about how massive things are going to happen soon.  I would suggest that Q post the same investigative data, but do it without the hype and innuendo about what everyone wants to see (arrests). Mr. PM, you do an outstanding job of not playing emotions.  I would suggest the same for Q.  I know they have much more information than we do and are professionals at this process, but don\'t string us along with hype.  Tell us like it is.  Give us the things to research, challenge our view, and educate us on the process, but leave out tag lines like; "ready for arrests", "get your popcorn", "enjoy the show", "boom", "boom week", "ready for pain", and countless other ones that lead your followers into emotional state to which they then have expectations.  I am sure I will be attacked for this post so please listen to this last part.  I support Q and pray for our country daily.  I hope all that Q stands for and says comes to pass.  My only request is for Q to follow Mr. Prayingmedic\'s idea about not using tag lines to tap into emotion and thus leading to expectation.  If you continue to do that and follow up with little real/visible results, it is only natural that you will start having people start to question the movement.
