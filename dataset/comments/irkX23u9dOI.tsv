Beatriz L	winwin getting screen time is all i need
moodle	I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE OUTFITS  AND THE STAGE IS GORGEOUS   MOST IMPORTANTLY, NCT KILLED IT ONCE AGAIN.
Gabriela Gutierrez	it is amazing how SM or whoever produce NCT just want to put Mark and Taeyong in front, consistently, permanently and in my opinion even aggressively, so the people that watch the NCT performance just have to see them all the presentation, no breaks for the audience. Not sure why they doing this when they have 8 other talented guys and actually very well looking too. But what amaze me the most is that after watching several presentation of NCT and even when Mark is always jumping for the whole stage like a little bunny and Taeyong is trying to fullfil the order of the producers to look like the "malo" leader guy, there are other members that quietly stand just for theirselves, I am talking about Yuta for example, what a manly man, very good looking and he just do his job behind or in front, wherever he has to be, he just slay the presentation. I can talk about Haechan that his moves in all coreographys are very sync, and of course the main vocalist Taeil and Doyoung that never dissapoint in their short opportunities to sing. How ever I insist in Yuta, he doesn't even try to got the attention but just watch the guy and you can see how he shines.
Akash Singh	Ty in the house
tael moon	Taeil is a cutie. I'm so proud of him, he always does his best for every performance. 💖
Paige Forth Lestrange	Now that I think of it, this is literally the first comeback as NCT 127 where they almost have the same outfits every stage!!!
