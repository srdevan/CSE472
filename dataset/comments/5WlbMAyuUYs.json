Thank you Kevens!!', 'Skip Acuff': 'Kēvens has applied his gift to the question whether Blue Wave voters are patriots.  I submit that Kēvens’ video, music, and lyrics says YES!  It’s a shot in the arm for you, and a head exploder to every soul and spirit who has been irredeemably lost to Trumpism and its enablers and allies here and abroad.  For those who ask, “irredeemably lost” = those who still identify their personal interests with Trump and the GOP, despite (or because of) the events and disclosures of the Kavanaugh nomination hearings led by the oldest hardline misogynists outside of Saudi Arabia, Trump’s relentlessly cruel persecution of folks seeking asylum from unspeakable horrors in their native lands, the Khashoggi murder and Trump’s handling of the aftermath, and the GOP’s unprecedented, still ongoing avalanche of lie-soaked propaganda during the campaign for the November 6, 2018 midterm elections. \n\nFriends, unless we prevail and preserve the patriotism depicted in Kēvens video, America will for the foreseeable future lose its pre-Trump reputation, still not fully earned, as the land of the free, home of the brave, of truth, justice, and the American Dream. The WH’s recent statement that the Saudis’ version of the Khashoggi murder, i.e., that he brought fists to a bone saw fight, is credible, has earned us the contempt of rational, democracy-minded people throughout the world.  Let’s show the world that the Trump fiasco is a fluke, that we’re so much better than that, and that the majority of us want preserve the uniquely American aspirations displayed in Kēvens’ song and poignant imagery.  PLEASE send “Sweet Lady Liberty” to everyone in your social network and urge them to do the same ad infinitum.
